[0.00-26.48]  CHAPTER I.
[26.48-33.12]  The year 1847 marked a period of great territorial acquisition by the American people, with incalculable
[33.12-36.20]  additions to their actual and potential wealth.
[36.20-40.96]  By the rational compromise with England in the dispute over the Oregon region, President
[40.96-48.60]  Polk had secured during 1846 for undisturbed settlement 300,000 square miles of forest, fertile
[48.60-53.16]  land, and fisheries, including the whole Farak Columbia Valley.
[53.16-57.24]  Our active policy of the Pacific dated from that hour.
[57.24-63.08]  With swift and clinching succession came the Melodramatic Mexican War, and February 1848
[63.08-68.20]  saw another vast territory, south of Oregon and west of the Rocky Mountains, added by
[68.20-70.76]  treaty to the United States.
[70.76-75.56]  Thus in about 18 months, there had been pieced into the national domain for a quick development
[75.56-81.20]  and exploitation, a region as large as the entire Union of 13 states at the close of the
[81.20-83.16]  War of Independence.
[83.16-88.28]  Moreover, within its boundaries was embraced all the great American Goldfield, just on the
[88.28-93.36]  eve of discovery, for a marshal had detected the shining particles in the mill race, at
[93.36-99.00]  the foot of the Sierra Nevada, nine days before Mexico signed away her rights in California,
[99.00-103.52]  and in all the vague remote hinterland facing Cathayward.
[103.52-107.76]  Equally momentous were the times in Europe, where the attempt to secure opportunities of
[107.84-113.20]  expansion, as well as larger liberty for the individual, took quite different form.
[113.20-117.64]  The old, absolute system of government was fast breaking up, and ancient thrones were
[117.64-118.84]  tottering.
[118.84-124.00]  The red lava of deep revolutionary fires oozed up through many glowing cracks in the political
[124.00-127.92]  crust, and all the social strata were shaken.
[127.92-132.88]  That the wild outbursts of insurrection midway in the fifth decade failed and died away,
[132.88-134.36]  was not surprising.
[134.36-139.64]  For the super-encomment deposits of tradition and convention were thick, but the retrospect
[139.64-144.68]  indicates that many reforms and political changes were accomplished, although the process
[144.68-151.00]  involved the exile of not a few ardent spirits to America, to become leading statesmen, inventors,
[151.00-153.72]  journalists, and financiers.
[153.72-160.16]  In 1847, too, Russia began her tremendous march eastward into Central Asia, just as France
[160.16-164.84]  was solidifying her first gains on the literal of Northern Africa.
[164.84-169.44]  In England, the fierce fervor of the charters movement, with its violent rhetoric as to
[169.44-174.96]  the rights of man, was sobering down and passing pervasively into numerous practical schemes
[174.96-181.96]  for social and political amelioration, constituting in their entirety a most profound change throughout
[181.96-185.00]  every part of the national life.
[185.00-190.12]  According to such times, Thomas Alva Edison was born, and his relations to them and to
[190.12-195.00]  the events of the past sixty years are the subject of this narrative.
[195.00-200.76]  Aside from the personal interest that attaches to the picturesque career, so typically American,
[200.76-205.24]  there is a broader aspect in which the work of the Franklin of the nineteenth century
[205.24-208.64]  touches the welfare and progress of the race.
[208.64-214.20]  It is difficult at any time to determine the effect of any single invention, and the investigation
[214.20-218.48]  becomes more difficult, where inventions of the first class have been crowded upon each
[218.48-222.12]  other in rapid and bewildering succession.
[222.12-226.64]  But it will be admitted that in Edison, one deals with a central figure of the great
[226.64-232.00]  age that saw the invention and introduction in practical form of the telegraph, the submarine
[232.00-238.04]  cable, the telephone, the electric light, the electric railway, the electric trolley
[238.12-245.20]  car, the storage battery, the electric motor, the phonograph, the wireless telegraph, and
[245.20-250.64]  that the influence of these on the worlds affairs has not been excelled at any time by that
[250.64-254.80]  of any other corresponding advances in the arts and sciences.
[254.80-259.84]  These pages deal with Edison's share in the great work of the last half century in a bridging
[259.84-266.36]  distance, communicating intelligence, lessening toil, improving illumination, recording forever
[266.44-272.16]  the human voice, and on behalf of inventive genius it may be urged that its beneficent
[272.16-278.04]  results and gifts to mankind compare with any to be credited to statesmen, warrior, or
[278.04-281.44]  creative writer of the same period.
[281.44-285.84]  Viewed from the standpoint of inventive progress, the first half of the nineteenth century
[285.84-291.24]  had passed very profitably when Edison appeared, every year marked by some notable achievement
[291.24-295.84]  in the arts and sciences, with promise of its early and abundant fruition in commerce
[295.84-297.52]  and industry.
[297.52-302.20]  There had been exactly four decades of steam navigation on American waters, railways
[302.20-307.28]  were growing at the rate of nearly one thousand miles annually, gas had become familiar as
[307.28-312.52]  a means of illumination in large cities, looms and tools and printing presses were everywhere
[312.52-316.52]  being liberated from the slow toil of manpower.
[316.52-319.12]  The first photographs had been taken.
[319.12-324.20]  Chloriform, nitrous oxide gas, and ether had been placed at the service of the physician
[324.24-329.96]  in saving life, and the revolver, gun cotton, and nitroglycerin added to the agency each
[329.96-331.72]  for slaughter.
[331.72-336.96]  New metals, chemicals, and elements had become available in large numbers, gases had been
[336.96-343.60]  liquefied and solidified, and the range of useful heat and cold indefinitely extended.
[343.60-349.00]  The safety lamp had been given to the miner, the key son to the bridge builder, the anti-friction
[349.00-351.76]  metal to the mechanic for bearings.
[351.76-356.76]  It was already known how to vulcanize rubber, and how to galvanize iron.
[356.76-361.84]  The application of machinery in the harvest field had begun with the embryonic reaper, while
[361.84-366.96]  both the bicycle and the automobile were heralded in primitive prototypes.
[366.96-371.84]  The gigantic expansion of the iron and steel industry was foreshadowed in the change from
[371.84-374.52]  wood to coal in its melting furnaces.
[374.52-379.04]  The sewing machine had brought with it, like the friction match, one of the most profound
[379.04-384.16]  influences in modifying domestic life, and making it different from that of all preceding
[384.16-385.84]  time.
[385.84-391.16]  Even in 1847, few of these things had lost their novelty, most of them were in the earlier
[391.16-393.48]  stages of development.
[393.48-398.64]  But it is when we turn to electricity that the rich virgin condition of an inimitable
[398.64-401.80]  new kingdom of discovery is seen.
[401.80-407.08]  Perhaps the word utilization or application is better than discovery.
[407.08-413.12]  For then as now, an endless wealth of phenomena noted by experimenters from Gilbert to Franklin
[413.12-419.12]  and Faraday awaited the invention that could alone render them useful to mankind.
[419.12-425.52]  The 18th century keenly curious and ceaselessly active in this fascinating field of investigation
[425.52-431.12]  had not, after all, left much of a legacy in either principles or appliances.
[431.12-436.96]  The loadstone and the compass, the frictional machine, the ladenjar, the nature of conductors
[436.96-442.84]  and insulators, the identity of electricity and the thunderstorm flash, the use of lightning
[442.84-447.44]  rods, the physiological effects of an electrical shock.
[447.44-453.04]  These constituted the bulk of the bequest to which philosophers were the only errors.
[453.04-457.40]  Pregnant with possibilities were many of the observations that had been recorded, but
[457.48-462.60]  these few appliances made up the meager kit of tools with which the 19th century entered
[462.60-468.76]  upon its task of acquiring the arts and conveniences, now such an intimate part of human nature's
[468.76-474.24]  daily food, that the average American today pays more for his electrical service than
[474.24-476.68]  he does for bread.
[476.68-481.52]  With the first year of the new century came Volta's invention of the chemical battery as a means
[481.52-483.76]  of producing electricity.
[483.80-488.80]  A well-known Italian picture represents Volta exhibiting his apparatus before the young
[488.80-494.20]  conqueror Napoleon, then ravishing from the peninsula its treasure of ancient art and
[494.20-497.00]  founding an ephemeral empire.
[497.00-502.36]  At such a moment, this gift of despoiled Italy to the world was a noble revenge, setting
[502.36-506.64]  in motion incalculable beneficent forces and agencies.
[506.64-513.20]  For the first time, man had command of a steady supply of electricity without toil or effort.
[513.20-517.64]  The useful results obtainable previously from the current of a frictional machine were
[517.64-521.88]  not much greater than those to be derived from the flight of a rocket.
[521.88-526.64]  While the frictional appliance is still employed in medicine, it ranks with a flintax in the
[526.64-529.56]  tinderbox in industrial obsolescence.
[529.56-532.36]  No art or trade could be founded on it.
[532.36-538.08]  No diminution of daily work or increase of daily comfort could be secured with it.
[538.08-542.84]  But the little battery with its metal plates in a weak solution proved a perennial reservoir
[542.84-549.20]  of electrical energy, safe and controllable, from which supplies could be drawn at will.
[549.20-552.44]  That which was wild had become domesticated.
[552.44-556.44]  Regular crops took the place of haphazard greenings from break or prairie.
[556.44-561.08]  The possibility of electrical starvation was for ever left behind.
[561.08-565.96]  Immediately, new processes of inestimable value revealed themselves.
[565.96-568.36]  New methods were suggested.
[568.36-573.88]  Most all the electrical arts now employed made their beginnings in the next 25 years.
[573.88-578.80]  And while the more extensive of them depend today on the dynamo for electrical energy,
[578.80-583.44]  some of the most important still remain in loyal allegiance to the older source.
[583.44-589.40]  The battery itself soon underwent modifications, and new types were evolved, the storage,
[589.40-592.20]  the double fluid, and the dry.
[592.20-597.56]  Various analogies next pointed to the use of heat, and the thermoelectric cell emerged,
[597.56-602.28]  embodying the application of flame to the junction of two different metals.
[602.28-606.94]  Davy of the safety lamp, through a volume of current across the gap between two sticks
[606.94-612.92]  of charcoal, and the Volteic arc, forerunner of electrical lighting, shed its bright beams
[612.92-615.16]  upon a dazzled world.
[615.16-621.04]  The decomposition of water by electrolytic action was recognized and made the basis of communicating
[621.04-625.16]  at a distance, even before the days of the electromagnet.
[625.16-629.68]  The ties that bind electricity and magnetism and twinship of relation and interaction
[629.68-636.24]  were detected, and Faraday's work in induction gave the world at once the dynamo and the motor.
[636.24-639.30]  Hitch your wagon to a star, said Emerson.
[639.30-644.06]  To all the coal fields and all the waterfalls, Faraday had directly hitched the wheels of
[644.06-645.68]  industry.
[645.68-650.90]  Not only was it now possible to convert mechanical energy into electricity, cheaply and in
[650.90-656.18]  the inimitable quantities, but electricity at once showed its ubiquitous availability
[656.18-658.38]  as a mode of power.
[658.38-663.50]  Boats were propelled by it, cars were hauled, and even papers printed.
[663.50-668.44]  Electroplating became an art, and telegraphy sprang into active being on both sides of the
[668.44-670.18]  Atlantic.
[670.18-676.08]  At the time Edison was born in 1847, telegraphy, upon which he was to leave so indelible
[676.08-680.50]  and imprint, had barely struggled into acceptance by the public.
[680.50-686.42]  In England, Wheatstone and Cook had introduced a ponderous magnetic needle telegraph.
[686.42-693.00]  In America in 1840, Morse had taken out his first patent on an electromagnetic telegraph,
[693.00-696.86]  the principle of which is dominating in the art of this day.
[696.86-702.42]  Four years later, the memorable message, What Hath God Rot, was sent by young Miss Ellsworth
[702.42-708.14]  over his circuits, and incredulous Washington was advised by a wire of the action of the
[708.14-712.26]  Democratic Convention in Baltimore in nominating Polk.
[712.26-718.26]  By 1847, circuits had been strung between Washington and New York under private enterprise,
[718.26-723.78]  the government having declined to buy the more system for $100,000.
[723.78-728.82]  Everything was crude and primitive, the poles were 200 feet apart and could barely hold
[728.82-730.46]  up a wash line.
[730.46-736.18]  The slim, bare copper wire snapped on the least provocation, and the circuit was down for
[736.18-739.18]  36 days in the first six months.
[739.18-744.54]  The little glass knob insulators made seductive targets for ignorant sportsmen.
[744.54-749.42]  Attempts to insulate the line wire were limited, decoding it with tar or smearing it with wax
[749.42-752.46]  for the benefit of all the bees in the neighborhood.
[752.46-757.60]  The farthest western reach of the telegraph lines in 1847 was Pittsburgh, with three
[757.60-765.34]  ply iron wire mounted on square glass insulators, with a little wooden pent roof for protection.
[765.34-770.18]  In that office, where Andrew Carnegie was a messenger boy, the magnets in use to receive
[770.18-776.06]  the signals sent with the aid of powerful nitric acid batteries weighed as much as 75 pounds
[776.06-777.54]  apiece.
[777.54-782.74]  But the business was fortunately small at the outset, until the new device, patronized
[782.74-789.50]  chiefly by lottery men, had proved its utility, then came the great outburst of activity.
[789.50-794.90]  Within the score of years, telegraph wires covered the whole occupied country with a network,
[794.90-800.58]  and the first great electrical industry was a pronounced success, yielding to its pioneers
[800.58-803.94]  the first great harvest of electrical fortunes.
[803.94-809.34]  It had been a sharp struggle for bear existence, during which, such a man as the founder of Cornell
[809.34-814.50]  University, had been glad to get breakfast in New York with a quarter dollar picked up
[814.50-817.26]  on Broadway.
[817.26-818.10]  End of chapter 1
