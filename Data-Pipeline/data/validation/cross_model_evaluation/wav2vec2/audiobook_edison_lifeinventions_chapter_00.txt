INTRODUCTION TO EDISON HIS LIFE AND INVENTIONS THIS IS A LIBRAVAUX RECORDING ALL LIBRAVAUX RECORDINGS ARE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN FOR MORE INFORMATION OR TO VOLUNTEER PLEASE VISIT LIBRAVAUXEDOD ORGUE EDISON HIS LIFE AND INVENTIONS BY FRANK LEWIS DYER GENERAL COUNCIL FOR THE EDISON LABORATORY AND ALLIED INTERESTS AND THOMAS COMBERFORD MARTIN X PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS INTRODUCTION PRIOR TO THIS NO COMPLETE AUTHENTIC AND AUTHORIZED RECORD OF THE WORK OF MISTER EDISON DURING AN ACTIVE LIFE HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE WORLD THAT LIFE IF THERE IS ANYTHING IN HEREDITY IS VERY FAR FROM FINISHED AND WHILE IT CONTINUES THERE WILL BE NEW ACHIEVEMENT AN INSISTENTLY EXPRESS DESIRE ON THE PART OF THE PUBLIC FOR A DEFINITIVE BIOGRAPHY OF EDISON WAS THE REASON FOR THE FOLLOWING PAGES THE PRESENT AUTHORS DEEM T HEMSELVES HAPPY IN THE CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN THEM AND IN THE CONSTANT ASSISTANCE THEY HAVE ENJOYED FROM MISTER EDISON WHILE PREPARING THESE PAGES A GREAT MANY OF WHICH ARE ALTOGETHER HIS OWN THIS CO OPERATION IN NO SENSE RELIEVES THE AUTHORS OF RESPONSIBILITY AS TO ANY OF THE VIEWS OR STATEMENTS OF THEIR OWN THAT THE BOOK CONTAINS THEY HAVE REALIZED THE EXTREME RELUCTANCE OF MISTER EDISON TO BE MADE THE SUBJECT OF ANY BIOGRAPHY AT ALL WHILE HE HAS FELT THAT IF IT MUST BE WRITTEN IT WERE BEST DONE BY THE HAND S OF FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES OF LONG STANDING WHOSE JUDGMENT AND DISCRETION HE COULD TRUST AND WHOSE INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS WOULD SAVE HIM FROM MISREPRESENTATION THE AUTHORS OF THE BOOK ARE PROFOUNDLY CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT THE EXTRAORDINARY PERIOD OF ELECTRICAL DEVELOPMENT EMBRACED IN IT HAS BEEN PROLIFIC OF GREAT MEN THEY HAVE NAMED SOME OF THEM BUT THERE HAS BEEN NO IDEA OF SETTING FORTH VARIOUS ACHIEVEMENTS OR OF ASCRIBING DISTINCTIVE MERITS THIS TREATMENT IS DEVOTED TO ONE MAN WHOM HIS FELLOW CITIZENS HAVE CHOSE TO REGARD AS IN MANY WAYS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AMERICAN AT HIS FINEST FLOWERING IN THE FIELD OF INVENTION DURING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IT IS DESIGNED IN THESE PAGES TO BRING THE READER FACE TO FACE WITH EDISON TO GLANCE AT AN INTERESTING CHILDHOOD AND A YOUTHFUL PERIOD MARKED BY A CAPACITY FOR DOING THINGS AND BY AN INSATIABLE THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE THEN TO ACCOMPANY HIM INTO THE GREAT CREATIVE STRETCH OF FORTY YEARS DURING WHICH HE HAS DONE SO MUCH THIS BOOK SHOWS HIM PLUNGED DEEP LY INTO WORK FOR WHICH HE HAS ALWAYS HAD AN INCREDIBLE CAPACITY REVEALS THE EXERCISE OF HIS UNSURPASSED INVENTIVE ABILITY HIS KEEN REASONING POWERS HIS TENACIOUS MEMORY HIS FERTILITY OF RESOURCE FOLLOWS HIM THROUGH A SERIES OF INNUMERABLE EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED METHODICALLY REACHING OUT LIKE RAYS OF SEARCH LIGHT INTO ALL THE REGIONS OF SCIENCE AND NATURE AND FINALLY EXHIBITS HIM EMERGING TRIUMPHANTLY FROM COUNTLESS DIFFICULTIES BEARING WITH HIM IN NEW ARTS THE FRUITS OF VICTORI A STRUGGLE THESE VOLUMES AIM TO BE A BIOGRAPHY RATHER THAN A HISTORY OF ELECTRICITY BUT THEY HAVE HAD TO COVER SO MUCH GENERAL GROUND IN DEFINING THE RELATIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF EDISON TO THE ELECTRICAL ARTS THAT THEY SERVE TO PRESENT A PICTURE OF THE WHOLE DEVELOPMENT EFFECTED IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS THE MOST FRUITFUL THAT ELECTRICITY HAS KNOWN THE EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO AVOID TECHNIQUE AND ABTRUSE PHRASES BUT SOME DEGREE OF EXPLANATION HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY IN REGARD TO EACH GROUP OF INVENTIONS THE TASK OF THE AUTHORS HAS CONSISTED LARGELY IN SUMMARIZING FAIRLY THE METHODS AND PROCESSES EMPLOYED BY EDISON AND SOME IDEA OF THE DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED BY THEM IN SO DOING MAY BE REALIZED FROM THE FACT THAT ONE BRIEF CHAPTER FOR EXAMPLE THAT ON OR MILLING COVERS NINE YEARS OF MOST INTENSE APPLICATION AND ACTIVITY ON THE PART OF THE INVENTOR IT IS SOMETHING LIKE EXHIBITING THE GEOLOGICAL ERAS OF THE EARTH IN AN OUTLINE LANTERN SLIDE TO REDUCE ANY LABORATE SERIES OF STRENUOUS EXPERIMENTS AND A VAST VARIETY OF INGENIOUS APPARATUS TO THE SPACE OF A FEW HUNDRED WORDS A GREAT DEAL OF THIS NARRATIVE IS GIVEN IN MISTER EDISON'S OWN LANGUAGE FROM ORAL OR WRITTEN STATEMENTS MADE IN REPLY TO QUESTIONS ADDRESSED TO HIM WITH THE OBJECT OF SECURING ACCURACY A FURTHER LARGE PART IS BASED UPON THE PERSONAL
