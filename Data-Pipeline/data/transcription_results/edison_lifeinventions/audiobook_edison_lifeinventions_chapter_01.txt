[0.00-29.88]  1. The Year 1847 Marked a Period of Great Territorial
[29.88-36.20]  Acquisition by the American People, with incalculable additions to their actual and potential wealth.
[36.20-40.96]  By the rational compromise with England in the dispute over the Oregon region, President
[40.96-48.60]  Polk had secured during 1846 for undisturbed settlement 300,000 square miles of forest, fertile
[48.60-54.48]  land, and fisheries, including the whole Fair Columbia Valley. Our active policy of the
[54.48-59.96]  Pacific dated from that hour. With swift and clinching succession came the Melodramatic
[59.96-66.28]  Mexican War, and February 1848 saw another vast territory, south of Oregon, and west
[66.28-72.44]  of the Rocky Mountains, added by treaty to the United States. Thus in about 18 months,
[72.44-77.20]  there had been pieced into the National Domain for a quick development and exploitation,
[77.20-83.16]  a region as large as the entire Union of 13 states at the close of the War of Independence.
[83.16-88.20]  Moreover, within its boundaries was embraced all the great American Goldfield, just on
[88.20-93.36]  the eve of discovery, for Marshall had detected the shining particles in the mill-race, at
[93.36-99.00]  the foot of the Sierra Nevada, nine days before Mexico signed away her rights in California,
[99.00-104.84]  and in all the vague remote hinterland facing Cathayward. Equally momentous were the times
[104.84-110.36]  in Europe, where the attempt to secure opportunities of expansion, as well as larger liberty for
[110.36-115.08]  the individual, took quite different form. The old, absolute system of government was
[115.08-120.72]  fast breaking up, and ancient thrones were tottering. The red lava of deep revolutionary
[120.72-125.88]  fires oozed up through many glowing cracks in the political crust, and all the social
[125.88-131.32]  strata were shaken. That the wild outbursts of insurrection midway in the fifth decade
[131.32-136.52]  failed and died away was not surprising, for the super-encomment deposits of tradition
[136.52-141.96]  and convention were thick. But the retrospect indicates that many reforms and political
[141.96-147.16]  changes were accomplished, although the process involved the exile of not a few ardent spirits
[147.16-154.88]  to America, to become leading statesmen, inventors, journalists, and financiers. In 1847,
[154.88-160.96]  too, Russia began her tremendous march eastward into Central Asia, just as France was solidifying
[160.96-166.56]  her first gains on the literal of Northern Africa. In England, the fierce fervor of the
[166.56-172.24]  chartist movement, with its violent rhetoric as to the rights of man, was sobering down and
[172.24-177.76]  passing pervasively into numerous practical schemes for social and political amelioration,
[177.76-183.20]  constituting in their entirety a most profound change throughout every part of the national
[183.20-190.24]  life. In two such times, Thomas Alva Edison was born, and his relations to them and to the
[190.24-196.40]  events of the past 60 years are the subject of this narrative. Aside from the personal interest
[196.40-202.16]  that attaches to the picturesque career, so typically American, there is a broader aspect in which
[202.16-207.44]  the work of the Franklin of the 19th century touches the welfare and progress of the race.
[208.32-212.88]  It is difficult at any time to determine the effect of any single invention,
[212.88-217.60]  and the investigation becomes more difficult, where inventions of the first class have been
[217.60-224.08]  crowded upon each other in rapid and bewildering succession. But it will be admitted that in Edison,
[224.08-229.36]  one deals with a central figure of the great age that saw the invention and introduction in practical
[229.36-237.04]  form of the telegraph, the submarine cable, the telephone, the electric light, the electric railway,
[237.04-243.52]  the electric trolley car, the storage battery, the electric motor, the phonograph, the wireless
[243.52-250.16]  telegraph, and that the influence of these on the worlds affairs has not been excelled at any time
[250.16-256.16]  by that of any other corresponding advances in the arts and sciences. These pages deal with Edison's
[256.16-262.40]  share in the great work of the last half century in a bridging distance, communicating intelligence,
[262.40-268.96]  lessening toil, improving illumination, recording forever the human voice, and on behalf of
[268.96-274.40]  inventive genius it may be urged that its beneficent results and gifts to mankind,
[274.40-279.68]  compare with any to be credited to statesmen, warrior, or creative writer of the same period.
[281.12-286.64]  Viewed from the standpoint of inventive progress, the first half of the 19th century had passed very
[286.64-291.84]  profitably when Edison appeared, every year marked by some notable achievement in the arts and
[291.84-297.84]  sciences, with promise of its early and abundant fruition in commerce and industry. There had been
[297.84-303.20]  exactly four decades of steam navigation on American waters, railways were growing at the rate
[303.20-309.12]  of nearly 1,000 miles annually, gas had become familiar as a means of illumination in large cities,
[309.76-314.40]  looms and tools and printing presses were everywhere being liberated from the slow
[314.40-322.08]  toil of manpower. The first photographs had been taken. Chloriform, nitrous oxide gas and ether
[322.08-326.80]  had been placed at the service of the physician in saving life, and the revolver,
[326.80-333.52]  gun cotton and nitroglycerin added to the agency for slaughter. New metals, chemicals and elements
[333.52-339.76]  had become available in large numbers, gases had been liquefied and solidified, and the range
[339.76-345.84]  of useful heat and cold indefinitely extended. The safety lamp had been given to the miner,
[345.84-350.72]  the key son to the bridge builder, the anti-friction metal to the mechanic for bearings.
[351.44-355.76]  It was already known how to vulcanize rubber and how to galvanize iron.
[356.48-361.52]  The application of machinery in the harvest field had begun with the embryonic reaper,
[361.52-365.92]  while both the bicycle and the automobile were heralded in primitive prototypes.
[366.72-371.92]  The gigantic expansion of the iron and steel industry was foreshadowed in the change from wood
[371.92-377.68]  to coal in its melting furnaces. The sewing machine had brought with it, like the friction match,
[377.76-383.20]  one of the most profound influences in modifying domestic life, and making it different from that
[383.20-390.56]  of all preceding time. Even in 1847, few of these things had lost their novelty. Most of them were
[390.56-396.32]  in the earlier stages of development. But it is when we turn to electricity that the rich
[396.32-402.48]  virgin condition of an inimitable new kingdom of discovery is seen. Perhaps the word
[402.48-409.44]  utilization or application is better than discovery. For then as now, an endless wealth of
[409.44-415.52]  phenomena noted by experimenters from Gilbert to Franklin and Faraday awaited the invention
[415.52-421.68]  that could alone render them useful to mankind. The 18th century, keenly curious and
[421.68-427.20]  ceaselessly active in this fascinating field of investigation, had not, after all, left
[427.20-433.44]  much of a legacy in either principles or appliances. The loadstone in the compass, the frictional
[433.44-440.16]  machine, the ladenjar, the nature of conductors and insulators, the identity of electricity and the
[440.16-446.40]  thunderstorm flash, the use of lightning rods, the physiological effects of an electrical shock.
[447.04-451.76]  These constituted the bulk of the bequest to which philosophers were the only errors.
[452.56-456.48]  Pregnant with possibilities were many of the observations that had been recorded.
[457.04-462.56]  But these few appliances made up the meager kit of tools, with which the 19th century entered
[462.56-468.72]  upon its task of acquiring the arts and conveniences, now such an intimate part of human nature's
[468.72-474.72]  daily food, that the average American today pays more for his electrical service than he does for
[474.72-480.80]  bread. With the first year of the new century came Volta's invention of the chemical battery
[480.88-486.72]  as a means of producing electricity. A well-known Italian picture represents Volta,
[486.72-492.48]  exhibiting his apparatus before the young conqueror Napoleon, then ravishing from the peninsula its
[492.48-498.56]  treasure of ancient art and founding an ephemeral empire. At such a moment, this gift of
[498.56-504.88]  despoiled Italy to the world was a noble revenge, setting in motion incalculable beneficent forces
[504.88-511.20]  and agencies. For the first time, man had command of a steady supply of electricity without
[511.20-517.44]  toil or effort. The useful results obtainable previously from the current of a frictional machine
[517.44-520.88]  were not much greater than those to be derived from the flight of a rocket.
[521.60-526.56]  While the frictional appliance is still employed in medicine, it ranks with a flint ax in the
[526.56-533.04]  tinderbox in industrial obsolescence. No art or trade could be founded on it. No diminution of
[533.04-538.96]  daily work or increase of daily comfort could be secured with it. But the little battery with
[538.96-544.96]  its metal plates in a weak solution proved a perennial reservoir of electrical energy safe and
[544.96-551.92]  controllable from which supplies could be drawn at will. That which was wild had become domesticated.
[551.92-557.28]  Regular crops took the place of haphazard gleanings from break or prairie. The possibility of
[557.28-564.16]  electrical starvation was for ever left behind. Immediately new processes of inestimable value
[564.16-570.88]  revealed themselves. New methods were suggested. Almost all the electrical arts now employed made
[570.88-576.32]  their beginnings in the next 25 years. And while the more extensive of them depend today on the
[576.32-581.76]  dynamo for electrical energy, some of the most important still remain in loyal allegiance to the
[581.76-588.24]  older source. The battery itself soon underwent modifications, and new types were evolved,
[588.24-594.72]  the storage, the double fluid, and the dry. Various analogies next pointed to the use of heat,
[594.72-600.48]  and the thermoelectric cell emerged, embodying the application of flame to the junction of two
[600.48-606.64]  different metals. Davy of the safety lamp threw a volume of current across the gap between two
[606.96-613.20]  sticks of charcoal, and the Volteic arc, forerunner of electrical lighting, shed its bright beams upon
[613.20-619.84]  a dazzled world. The decomposition of water by electrolytic action was recognized and made the
[619.84-626.00]  basis of communicating at a distance, even before the days of the electromagnet. The ties that bind
[626.00-632.00]  electricity and magnetism and twinship of relation and interaction were detected, and Faraday's work
[632.00-637.60]  and induction gave the world at once the dynamo and the motor. Hits your wagon to a star,
[637.60-643.60]  said Emerson. To all the coal fields and all the waterfalls, Faraday had directly hitched the
[643.60-649.84]  wheels of industry. Not only was it now possible to convert mechanical energy into electricity,
[649.84-655.44]  cheaply and in the limitable quantities, but electricity at once showed its ubiquitous
[655.44-661.84]  availability as a mode of power. Boats were propelled by it, cars were hauled, and even papers
[661.92-668.16]  printed. Electroplating became an art, and telegraphy spraying into active being on both sides
[668.16-675.52]  of the Atlantic. At the time Edison was born in 1847, telegraphy upon which he was to leave so
[675.52-681.76]  indelible an imprint had barely struggled into acceptance by the public. In England, Wheatstone
[681.76-688.72]  and Cook had introduced a ponderous magnetic needle telegraph. In America in 1840, Morse had
[688.72-694.56]  taken out his first patent on an electromagnetic telegraph, the principle of which is dominating
[694.56-701.28]  in the art to this day. Four years later, the memorable message, What-Hath-God-Rot, was sent by
[701.28-707.12]  young Miss Ellsworth over his circuits, and incredulous Washington was advised by a wire
[707.12-711.04]  of the action of the Democratic Convention in Baltimore in nominating Polk.
[712.08-718.00]  By 1847, circuits had been strung between Washington and New York under private enterprise,
[718.00-724.56]  the government having declined to buy the more system for $100,000. Everything was crude and
[724.56-731.52]  primitive. The poles were 200 feet apart and could barely hold up a wash line. The slim, bare
[731.52-737.84]  copper wire snapped on the least provocation, and the circuit was down for 36 days in the first six
[737.84-743.20]  months. The little glass knob insulators made seductive targets for ignorant sportsmen.
[744.00-749.36]  Attempts to insulate the line wire were limited to coating it with tar or smearing it with wax
[749.36-754.72]  for the benefit of all the bees in the neighborhood. The farthest western reach of the telegraph lines
[754.72-762.32]  in 1847 was Pittsburgh, with three ply iron wire mounted on square glass insulators with a little
[762.32-768.56]  wooden pent roof for protection. In that office, where Andrew Carnegie was a messenger boy,
[768.56-774.08]  the magnets in use to receive the signals sent with the aid of powerful nitric acid batteries
[774.08-780.48]  weighed as much as 75 pounds apiece. But the business was fortunately small at the outset,
[780.48-785.44]  until the new device, patronized chiefly by lottery men, had proved its utility.
[786.24-792.16]  Then came the great outburst of activity. Within the score of years, telegraph wires covered the
[792.16-797.84]  whole occupied country with a network, and the first great electrical industry was a pronounced
[797.92-802.88]  success, yielding to its pioneers the first great harvest of electrical fortunes.
[803.68-809.36]  It had been a sharp struggle for bear existence, during which, such a man as the founder of Cornell
[809.36-815.20]  University, had been glad to get breakfast in New York with a quarter dollar picked up on Broadway.
