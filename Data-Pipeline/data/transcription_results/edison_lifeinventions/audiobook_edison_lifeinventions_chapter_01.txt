[15.72-21.92]  Edison, his life, and inventions. By Frank Lewis-Dyer, General Counsel for the Edison Laboratory
[21.92-28.08]  and Allied Interests, and Thomas Comerford Martin, ex-president of the American Institute
[28.08-31.26]  of Electrical Engineers.
[31.26-37.16]  Introduction Prior to this, no complete, authentic, and authorized
[37.16-42.72]  record of the work of Mr. Edison during an active life has been given to the world. That
[42.72-48.56]  life, if there is anything in heredity, is very far from finished, and while it continues,
[48.56-53.72]  there will be new achievement. An insistently expressed desire on the part of the public
[53.72-59.24]  for a definitive biography of Edison was the reason for the following pages. The present
[59.24-64.32]  authors deem themselves happy in the confidence reposed in them, and in the constant assistance
[64.32-69.16]  they have enjoyed from Mr. Edison while preparing these pages, a great many of which are all
[69.16-75.20]  together his own. This cooperation, in no sense, relieves the authors of responsibility
[75.20-80.64]  as to any of the views or statements of their own that the book contains. They have realized
[80.72-86.12]  the extreme reluctance of Mr. Edison to be made this subject of any biography at all.
[86.12-90.52]  While he has felt that, if it must be written, it were best done by the hands of friends
[90.52-95.16]  and associates of long-standing, whose judgment and discretion he could trust, and whose
[95.16-100.16]  intimate knowledge of the facts would save him from misrepresentation.
[100.16-104.68]  The authors of the book are profoundly conscious of the fact that the extraordinary period
[104.68-109.44]  of electrical development embraced in it has been prolific of great men. They have named
[109.44-114.32]  some of them, but there has been no idea of setting forth various achievements or of
[114.32-119.48]  ascribing distinctive merits. This treatment is devoted to one man whom his fellow citizens
[119.48-125.88]  have chosen to regard, as in many ways, representative of the American at his finest, flowering in
[125.88-131.32]  the field of invention during the nineteenth century. It is designed in these pages to bring
[131.32-136.32]  the reader face to face with Edison, to glance at an interesting childhood and a youthful
[136.32-142.44]  period marked by a capacity for doing things and by an insatiable thirst for knowledge,
[142.44-146.60]  then to accompany him into the great creative stretch of forty years during which he has
[146.60-152.00]  done so much. This book shows him plunged deeply into work for which he has always had
[152.00-157.88]  an incredible capacity, reveals the exercise of his unsurpassed inventive ability, his
[157.88-164.24]  keen reasoning powers, his tenacious memory, his fertility of resource, follows him through
[164.24-169.28]  his series of innumerable experiments, conducted methodically, reaching out like rays of
[169.28-174.52]  search light into all the regions of science and nature, and finally exhibits him emerging
[174.52-180.08]  triumphantly from countless difficulties bearing with him in new arts the fruits of victorious
[180.08-186.64]  struggle. These volumes aim to be a biography rather than a history of electricity, but they
[186.64-191.12]  have had to cover so much general ground in defining the relations and contributions
[191.12-196.32]  of Edison to the electrical arts that they serve to present a picture of the whole development
[196.32-202.20]  affected in the last fifty years, the most fruitful that electricity has known. The effort
[202.20-207.60]  has been made to avoid technique and aptruce phrases, but some degree of explanation has
[207.60-212.96]  been absolutely necessary in regard to each group of inventions. The task of the authors
[212.96-218.88]  has consisted largely in summarizing fairly the methods and processes employed by Edison,
[218.88-223.84]  as some idea of the difficulties encountered by them in so doing may be realized from
[223.84-229.28]  the fact that one brief chapter, for example, that on ore milling, covers nine years of
[229.28-234.56]  most intense application and activity on the part of the inventor. It is something like
[234.56-239.92]  exhibiting the geological areas of the earth in an outline lantern slide to reduce any
[239.92-245.76]  elaborate series of strenuous experiments and a vast variety of ingenious apparatus to
[245.76-251.04]  the space of a few hundred words. A great deal of this narrative is given in Mr. Edison's
[251.04-256.48]  own language from oral or written statements made and replied to questions addressed to him
[256.48-262.56]  with the object of securing accuracy. A further large part is based upon the personal contributions
[262.56-267.60]  of many loyal associates, and it is desired here to make grateful acknowledgement to such
[267.60-276.72]  collaborators as Mrs. Samuel Insol, E. H. Johnson, F. R. Upton, R. N. Dyer, S. B. Eaton,
[277.44-288.08]  Francis Jail, W. S. Andrews, W. J. J. Janks, W. J. Hammer, F. J. Sprig, W. S. Mallory,
[288.08-294.16]  and C. L. Clark, and others, without whose aid the issuance of this book would indeed have been
[294.16-300.88]  impossible. In particular, it is desired to acknowledge indebtedness to Mr. W. H. Meadowcroft,
[300.88-306.32]  not only for substantial aid in the literary part of the work, but for indefatigable effort to
[306.32-312.64]  group, classify, and summarize the boundless material embodied in Edison's notebooks and memorabilia
[312.64-319.44]  of all kinds now kept at the orange laboratory. Acknowledgement must also be made of the courtesy
[319.44-325.12]  and assistance of Mrs. Edison, and especially of the loan of many interesting and rare photographs
[325.12-328.88]  from her private collection. End of Introduction
