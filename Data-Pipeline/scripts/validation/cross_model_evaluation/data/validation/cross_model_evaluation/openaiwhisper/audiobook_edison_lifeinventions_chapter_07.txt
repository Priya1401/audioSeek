[20.96-29.92]  Frank Lewis-Dryer and Thomas Comerford Martin. Chapter 7, the Stockticker. The letters and figures
[29.92-36.00]  used in the language of the tape, set a well-known Boston Stocks speculator, are very few,
[36.00-42.64]  but they spell ruin in 99 million ways. It is not to be inferred, however, that the modern
[42.64-49.20]  Stockticker has anything to do with the making or losing of fortunes. There were regular daily stock
[49.20-57.84]  market reports in London newspapers in 1825 and New York soon followed the example. As far back as
[57.84-64.56]  1692, Hootin issued in London a weekly review of financial and commercial transactions,
[65.20-73.04]  upon which McCale based the lively narrative of stock speculation in the 17th century, given in
[73.04-80.08]  his famous history. That which the ubiquitous Stockticker has done is to give instantaneously
[80.08-86.64]  to the news of what the stock market is doing, so that at every minute, thousands of miles apart,
[87.20-95.12]  brokers, investors and gamblers may learn the exact conditions. The existence of such facilities
[95.12-102.00]  is to be admired rather than deplored. News is vital to Wall Street, and there is no living man
[102.00-107.76]  on whom the things in Wall Street are without effect. Financial history of the United States and
[107.76-114.96]  of the world, as shown by the prices of government bonds and general securities, has been told daily
[114.96-122.96]  for 40 years on these narrow strips of paper tape, of which thousands of miles are yearly run
[122.96-128.56]  through the tickers of the New York alone. It is true that the record of the chattering little
[128.56-135.52]  machine made in cannibalistic abbreviations on the tape can drive a man suddenly to the very verge
[135.52-142.56]  of insanity with joy or despair. But if there be blame for that, it attaches to the American
[142.64-148.64]  spirit of speculation and not to the ingenious mechanism which reads and registers the beating of
[148.64-155.44]  the financial pulse. Edison came first to New York in 1868 with his early stock printer,
[155.44-163.04]  which he tried unsuccessfully to sell. He went back to Boston and quite undismade got up a duplex
[163.04-169.04]  telegraph toward the end of my stay in Boston, he says, I obtained a loan of money,
[169.04-176.88]  amounting to $800 to build a particular kind of duplex telegraph for sending two messages
[176.88-183.04]  over a single wire simultaneously. The apparatus was built and I left the Western Union
[183.04-188.72]  ploy and went to Rochester, New York to test the apparatus on the lines of the Atlantic and
[188.72-195.36]  Pacific telegraph between that city and New York. But the assistant at the other end could not be
[195.44-202.24]  made to understand anything. Notwithstanding, I had written out a very minute description of just
[202.24-208.00]  what to do. After trying for a week, I gave it up and returned to New York with but a few
[208.00-215.52]  cents in my pocket. Thus, he who has never speculated in a stock in his life was destined to make
[215.52-222.00]  the beginnings of his own fortune, but by providing for others the apparatus that should bring to the
[222.80-229.60]  eye all over a great city, the momentary fluctuations of stocks and bonds. No one could have been
[229.60-237.28]  in dire poverty than he when the steamboat landed him in New York in 1869. He was in debt and his
[237.28-244.32]  few belongings in books and instruments had to be left behind. He was not far from starving. Mr. W.
[244.32-251.12]  S. Mallory and associate of many years quotes directly from him on this point. Some years ago,
[251.12-257.20]  we had a business negotiation in New York which made it necessary for Mr. Edison and me to visit
[257.20-263.84]  the city five or six times within a comparatively short period. It was our custom to leave orange
[263.84-270.00]  about 11 a.m. on arrival in New York to get our lunch before keeping the appointments, which were
[270.00-277.36]  usually made for two o'clock. Several of these lunches were at Damanico's, Sherries, and other places
[277.36-284.16]  of similar character. But one day, well and route, Mr. Edison sent. I have been to lunch with you
[284.16-290.56]  several times now today. I am going to take you to lunch with me and give you the finest lunch you
[290.56-297.36]  ever had. When we arrived at Hoboken, we took the downtown ferry across the Hudson and when we
[297.36-304.24]  arrived on the Manhattan side, Mr. Edison led the way to Smith and McNeil's opposite Washington
[304.24-310.88]  market and well known to old New Yorkers. We went inside and as soon as the waiter appeared, Mr.
[310.88-317.20]  Edison ordered apple dumplings and a cup of coffee for himself. He consumed his share of the lunch
[317.20-323.04]  with the greatest possible pleasure. Then as soon as he'd finished, he went to the cigar counter
[323.04-328.32]  and purchased cigars. As we walked to keep the appointment, he gave me the following reminiscence.
[329.28-335.12]  When he left Boston and decided to come to New York, he had only money enough for the trip.
[335.84-340.88]  After leaving the boat, his first thought was a breakfast, but he was without money to obtain it.
[341.60-347.68]  However, in passing a wholesale tea house, he saw a man tasting tea. So he went in and asked the
[347.68-353.52]  taster if he might have some of the tea. This the man gave him and thus he obtained his first
[353.52-359.36]  breakfast in New York. He knew a telegraph operator here and on him he depended a loan to tie
[359.36-365.60]  him over until such time as he should secure a position. During the day, he had succeeded in
[365.60-372.00]  locating this operator but found that he also was out of the job and that the best he could do was
[372.00-378.08]  loan him one dollar which he did. This small sum of money represented both food and lodging
[378.56-385.68]  time as work could be obtained. Edison said that as a result of the time consumed and the exercise
[385.68-391.68]  and walking while he found his friend, he was extremely hungry and that he gave most serious
[391.68-397.52]  consideration as to what he should buy in the way of food and what particular kind of food would
[397.52-404.48]  be most satisfying and filling. The result was that at Smith and McNeill's, he decided on Apple
[404.56-410.64]  dumplings and a cup of coffee that which he never ate anything more appetizing. It was not long
[410.64-415.84]  before he was at work and was able to live in a normal matter. During the Civil War, whether it's
[415.84-421.28]  enormous increase in the national debt and the volume of paper money, gold had gone to a high
[421.28-427.68]  premium and as ever by his fluctuations in the price of the value of other commodities it was
[427.68-433.36]  determined. This led to the creation of a gold room in Wall Street where the precious metal could
[433.36-439.36]  be delton while for dealings in stock there also extended the regular board and the open board
[439.36-446.08]  and the long room. Devoted to one but the leading object of speculation the gold room was the very
[446.08-451.92]  focus of all the financial and gambling activity of the time and its quotations governed trade
[451.92-459.20]  and commerce. At first notations in shock and on blackboard suffice but seeing their inadequacy
[459.28-466.08]  Dr. S.S. Laws, Vice President and Actual Presiding Officer of the Gold Exchange, devised and
[466.08-472.24]  introduced what was popularly known as the gold indicator. At first notations in shock and the
[472.24-480.08]  blackboard suffice but seeing their inadequacy Dr. S.S. Laws, Vice President and Actual Presiding
[480.08-485.92]  Officer of the Gold Exchange devised and introduced what was popularly known as the gold indicator.
[486.40-492.56]  This exhibited merely the prevailing price of gold but as its quotations changed from instant to
[492.56-500.16]  instant it was in a most literal sense the sinors of the neighboring eyes. One indicator looked upon
[500.16-506.32]  the gold room the other opened toward the street. Within the exchange the face could easily be seen
[506.32-512.96]  high up on the west wall of the room and the machine was operated by Mr. Merceau S.O. the official
[513.44-520.32]  registrar of the gold board. Dr. Laws who, afterward, became president of the State University of Missouri
[520.32-526.64]  was an inventor of unusual ability and attainments. In his early youth he had earned his livelihood
[526.64-532.64]  in a tool factory and apparently with his savings he went to Princeton where he studied electricity
[532.64-539.68]  under no less a teacher than the famous Joseph Henry. At the outbreak of the war in 1861 he was
[539.68-545.76]  president of one of the Presbyterians, Sononical Colleges of the South whose buildings passed into
[545.76-552.64]  the hands of the government. Going to Europe he returned to New York in 1863 and became interested
[552.64-559.60]  with a relative in financial matters. His connection with the gold exchange soon followed when it was
[559.60-566.64]  organized. The indicating mechanism he devised was electrical controlled as central by two circuit
[566.64-572.96]  closed keys and was a prototype of all the later and modern step-by-step printing telegraphs
[572.96-580.00]  upon which the distribution of financial news depended. The fraction drum of the indicator could
[580.00-586.48]  be driven in either direction, known as the advantage and retrograde movements and was divided
[586.48-594.00]  and marked into eighths. It geared into a unit drum which as do speed indicators and cycle
[594.16-600.08]  meters. Four electrical pulsations were required to move the drum the distance between the fractions.
[600.88-606.56]  The general operation was simple and in normally active times the mechanism and the registrar were
[606.56-612.40]  equal to all emergencies but it is obvious that the recorder had to be carried away to the
[612.40-620.16]  broker's office and other places by messengers and the delay confusion and mistakes soon suggested
[620.16-626.32]  that doctor laws the desirability of having a number of indicators at such scattered points
[626.96-633.44]  operated by a master transmitter and dispersing with the regimens of noisy boys. He secured this
[633.44-639.76]  privilege of distribution and residing from the exchange devoted his exclusive attention to the
[639.76-647.44]  gold reporting telegraph which he patented and for which at the end of 1866 he had scarcely 50
[647.44-653.84]  subscribers. His indicators were small oblong boxes in the front of which was a long slot
[654.32-660.48]  allowing the dial as they traveled past inside to show the numerals consisting the quotation.
[660.48-665.68]  The dials or wheels being arranged in a row horizontally overlapping each other
[665.68-672.00]  as in modern fair registers which are now seen on most trolley cars. It was not long before there
[672.00-678.24]  were 300 subscribers but the very success of this device brought competition and improvements.
[678.24-684.24]  Mr. E. A. Callahan an ingenious printing telegraph operator saw that there were
[684.24-690.32]  unexhaustible possibilities in the idea and his foresight and inventiveness made him the father
[690.32-697.04]  of the ticker in connection with which he was thus like laws one of the first to grasp and exploit
[697.12-703.20]  the underlying principle of the central station as a universal source of supply. The genius of this
[703.20-710.96]  invention Mr. Callahan was told in an interesting way. In 1867 on the site of the present mills building
[710.96-717.12]  on Broadway Street opposite the stock exchange of today was an old building which had been cut up to
[717.12-722.96]  subverses the necessities of his occupants all engaged in the dealing of gold and stocks.
[722.96-727.84]  It had one main entrance from the street to a hallway from which entrance to the offices of
[727.84-734.48]  two prominent broker firms was obtained. Each firm had its own army of boys numbering from 12 to 15
[734.48-739.52]  whose duties were to ascertain the latest quotations from the different exchanges.
[739.52-745.04]  Each boy devoted his attention to some particularly active stock pushing each other to get into
[745.04-750.88]  those narrow quarters yelling out the prices at the door and pushing back for later ones.
[750.88-757.52]  The hustle made this doorway to me a most undesirable refuge from an April shower. I was simply
[757.52-763.84]  world into the street. I naturally thought that much of this noise and confusion might be dispersed
[763.84-769.36]  and that the prices might be furnished through some system of telegraphy which would not require
[769.36-775.20]  the employment of skilled operators. The conception of the stock ticker dates from this incident.
[775.20-780.80]  Mr. Callahan's first idea was to distribute gold quotations and to this end he devised an
[780.80-787.68]  indicator. It consisted of two dials mounted separately. Each revolved by an electromagnet so
[787.68-793.52]  that the desired figures were brought to an aperture in the case in closing the apparatus as in the
[793.52-800.08]  laws system. Each shaft with this dial was provided with two ratcheted wheels, one the reverse of
[800.16-806.48]  the other, one was used in connection with the propelling lever which was provided to a paw to fit
[806.48-813.36]  into the teeth of the reversed ratcheted wheel on its forward movement. It was thus made impossible
[813.36-819.92]  for either dial to go by a momentum beyond its limit. Learning that Dr. Laws with the skillful aid
[819.92-827.04]  of F. L. Pope was already active in the same direction. Mr. Callahan with ReadyWit transformed
[827.04-833.28]  his indicator into a ticker that would make a printed record. The name of the ticker came
[833.28-838.64]  through the casual remark about an observer to whom the noise was the most striking feature of
[838.64-845.76]  the mechanism. Mr. Callahan removed the two dials and substituting type wheels turned the
[845.76-851.68]  movements face to face so that each type wheel could imprint its characters upon a paper tape
[851.68-857.12]  in two lines. Three wires stranded together from the central office to each instrument.
[857.68-862.96]  Of these one furnished the current for the alphabet wheel, one for the figure wheel,
[862.96-866.56]  and one for the mechanism that took care of inking and printing on the tape.
[867.44-874.00]  Callahan made the further innovation of insulating his circuit wires. Although the cost was then 40
[874.00-879.92]  times as great as that of bear wires, it will be understood that electromagnets were the ticker's
[879.92-886.40]  actuating agency. The ticker apparatus was placed under a neat glass shade and mounted on a shelf.
[886.96-893.28]  25 instruments were energized from one circuit and the quotations were supplied from a central
[893.28-900.16]  and 18 new street. The Gold and Staten Telegraph Company was promptly organized to supply two
[900.16-906.16]  brokers the system which was very rapidly adopted throughout the financial district of New York
[906.16-911.68]  at the southern tip of Manhattan Island. Quotations were transmitted by Morse Telegraph from
[911.68-918.32]  the floor of the stock exchange to the central and then distributed to the subscribers. Success
[918.32-924.00]  with the stock news system was instantaneous. It was at this juncture that Edison reached
[924.00-928.96]  New York and according to his own statement, found shelter at night in the battery room of a Gold
[928.96-934.72]  Indicator Company having meantime applied for a position as an operator with the Western Union.
[935.44-941.12]  He had to wait a few days and during this time he seized the opportunity to study the indicators
[941.12-945.52]  and the complicated general transmitter in the office controlled from the keyboard of the
[945.52-950.88]  operator on the floor of the Gold Exchange. What happened next has been the basis of many
[950.88-957.52]  inaccurate stories but is dramatic enough as told in Mr. Edison's own version. On the third day
[957.52-963.20]  of my arrival and while sitting in the office, the complicated general instrument for sending
[963.20-969.68]  on all the lines and which made a very great noise suddenly came to a stop with a crash.
[970.56-977.60]  Within two minutes, over 300 boys, a boy from every broker in the street, rushed upstairs and
[977.60-984.32]  crowded the long aisle and office that hardly had room for 100. All yelling that such and such a
[984.32-990.88]  broker's wire was out of order and to fix it at once. It was pandemonium and the man in charge
[990.88-997.04]  became so excited that he lost control of all knowledge he ever had. I went to the indicator
[997.04-1002.64]  and having studied it thoroughly knew where the trouble ought to be and found it. One of the
[1002.64-1008.88]  innumerable contact springs had broken off and fallen down between two gear wheels and stopped
[1008.88-1015.12]  the instrument but it was not very noticeable. As I went out to tell the man in charge what the matter
[1015.76-1022.08]  was, Dr. Laws appeared in the scene. The most excited person I had seen, he demanded of the man
[1022.08-1028.32]  the cause of the trouble but the man was speechless. I ventured to say that I knew what the problem was
[1028.32-1034.56]  and he said, fix it, fix it, be quick! I removed the spring and set the contact wheels at zero
[1034.56-1039.76]  and the line, battery and inspecting man all scattered through the financial district to set the
[1039.84-1046.64]  instruments. In about two hours things were working again. Dr. Laws came in to ask my name and what
[1046.64-1052.96]  I was doing. I told him and he asked me to come to his private office the following day. His office
[1052.96-1059.44]  was filled with stacks of books all relating to metaphysics and kindred matters. He asked me a great
[1059.44-1065.12]  many questions about the instruments and his system and I showed him how he could simplify things
[1065.20-1072.08]  generally. He then requested that I should call next day. On arrival he stated at once that he
[1072.08-1078.08]  had decided to put me in charge of a whole plant and that my salary would be $300 per month.
[1078.88-1084.32]  This was such a violent jump from anything I had ever seen before that it rather paralyzed me
[1084.32-1089.68]  for a while. I thought it was too much to be lasting but I determined to try and live up to the
[1089.68-1095.68]  salary. If 20 hours a day of hard work would do it I kept this position. Made many improvements
[1095.68-1101.76]  devised several stock tickers until the gold and stock telegraph company consolidated with the
[1101.76-1107.76]  gold indicator company. Certainly few changes in fortune have ever been more sudden and dramatic
[1107.76-1115.04]  in any notable career than this which thus placed in ill-clad, unkempt, half-starved, eager-led
[1115.04-1121.20]  in a position of such responsibility in days when the fluctuations in the price of gold at every
[1121.20-1127.12]  instant meant fortune or ruin to thousands. Edison barely 21 years old was a keen observer of
[1127.12-1132.96]  the stirring events around him. Wall Street is at any time an interesting study but it was never
[1132.96-1139.04]  at a more agitated and sensational period of its history than at this time. Edison's arrival in
[1139.04-1145.36]  New York coincided with an act of speculation in gold which may indeed be said to have provided
[1145.36-1152.48]  him with an occupation and was soon followed by the attempt of Mr. J. Gold and his associates to
[1152.48-1160.48]  corner the gold market, precipitating the Panic Black Friday, September 24th 1869. Securing its
[1160.48-1166.40]  important duties and the precious metals and thus assisting to create an artificial stringency
[1166.40-1171.52]  in the gold market, the government had made it a practice to revive the situation by selling
[1171.52-1177.44]  a million of gold each month. The medal was thus restarted into circulation. In some manner,
[1177.44-1183.60]  President Grant was persuaded that general conditions and the movement of the crops would be helped
[1183.60-1189.92]  if the sale of gold were suspended for a time and this put into effect. He went to visit an old friend
[1189.92-1195.68]  in the Pennsylvania remote from Railroad's Intelligress. The gold pool had acquired control of
[1195.68-1202.32]  $10 million in gold and drove the price upward rapidly from 144 toward their goal of 200.
[1202.88-1209.20]  On Black Friday, they purchased another $28 million at 160 and still the price went up.
[1209.20-1214.72]  The financial and commercial interests of the country were in Panic but the pool persevered
[1214.72-1220.88]  in its effort to corner gold with a profit of many millions contingent on success, yielding a
[1220.88-1226.80]  frantic request. President Grant, who returned to Washington, cost Secretary Bultwell of the
[1226.80-1233.12]  Treasury to throw $4 million of gold into the market. Relief was instantaneous. The corner
[1233.12-1239.68]  was broken but the harm had been done. Edison's remarks shed a vivid sidelight on this extraordinary
[1239.68-1246.24]  episode. On Black Friday, he says, we had a very exciting time with the indicators. The
[1246.24-1252.00]  gold and fist crowd had cornered gold and had run the quotations up faster than the indicator could
[1252.00-1257.92]  follow. The indicator was composed of several wheels. On the circumference of each wheel were
[1257.92-1263.20]  the numerals and one wheel had fractions. It worked in the same way as an ordinary counter.
[1263.76-1270.32]  One wheel made 10 revolutions and at the 10th it advanced the adjacent wheel and this in its turn
[1270.32-1276.64]  having gone 10 revolutions advanced the next wheel and so on. On the morning of Black Friday,
[1276.64-1282.88]  the indicator was quoting 150 premium whereas the bids by gold's agents in the gold room were
[1282.88-1290.72]  165 for 5 millions or any part. We had a paperweight at the transmitter to speed it up and by one
[1290.72-1297.36]  o'clock reached the right quotation. The excitement was prodigious. New York as well as Broad Street
[1297.36-1303.28]  was jammed with excited people. I sat on top of the Western Union telegraph booth to watch the
[1303.28-1309.44]  surging crazy crowd. One man came to the booth grabbed a pencil and attempted to write a message
[1309.44-1315.28]  to Boston. The first stroke went clear off the blank. He was so excited that he had the operator
[1315.28-1321.52]  write the message for him. I made great excitement. Spire the banker went crazy and it took five
[1321.52-1327.52]  men to hold him and everybody lost their head. The Western Union operator came to me and said,
[1327.52-1334.88]  shake, Edison, we are okay. We've got a scent. I felt very happy because we were poor. These
[1334.88-1340.48]  occasions are very enjoyable to a poor man but they rarely occur. There is a calm sense of
[1340.48-1345.44]  detachment about this description that has been possessed by the narrator even in the most
[1345.44-1352.08]  anxious moments of his career. He was determined to see all it could be seen and quitting his
[1352.08-1357.04]  perch on the telegraph booth sought the more secluded headquarters of the pool forces.
[1357.76-1363.68]  A friend of mine was an operator who worked in the office of Belden and Company, 60 Broadway,
[1363.68-1370.00]  which were headquarters for Fisk. Mr. Gould was uptown in the area office in the Grand Opera House.
[1370.64-1376.88]  The firm on Broad Street, Smith and Gould and Martin was the other branch. All were connected
[1376.88-1383.68]  with wires. Gould seemed to be in charge. Fisk being the executive downtown. Fisk wore a velvet
[1383.68-1390.48]  corduroy coat and a very peculiar vest. He was very chipper and seemed to be lighthearted and happy.
[1390.48-1396.32]  Sitting around the room where about a dozen fine-looking men all had the complexion of cadavers.
[1396.32-1401.20]  There was a basket of champagne. Hundreds of boys were rushing and paying checks,
[1401.20-1407.52]  all checks being payable to Belden and Company. When James Brown, a Brown Brothers and Company,
[1407.52-1413.20]  broke the corner by selling 5 million gold. All payments were repudiated by Smith, Gould and
[1413.20-1418.88]  Martin. But they continued to receive checks at Belden and Companies for some time until the
[1418.88-1423.84]  street got wind of the game. There was some kind of conspiracy with the government people which I
[1423.84-1429.12]  could not make out, but I heard messages that opened into my eyes as to the ramifications of
[1429.12-1436.00]  Wall Street. Gould fell to 132 and it took us all night to get the indicator back to that quotation.
[1436.64-1441.76]  All night long the streets were full of people. Every broker's office was brilliantly lighted
[1441.76-1448.24]  all night and all hands were at work. The clearinghouse for Gould had been swamped and always mixed up.
[1448.32-1454.00]  No one knew if he was bankrupt or not. Edison in those days rather liked the modest coffee shops
[1454.00-1459.92]  and mentions visiting one. When on the New York number one wire that I worked in Boston,
[1459.92-1465.52]  there was an operator named Jerry Brost at the other end. He was a first-class receiver and
[1465.52-1472.00]  rapid sender. We made up a scheme to hold this wire so he changed one letter of the alphabet
[1472.00-1477.28]  and as soon as I got used to it and finally we changed three letters. If any operator tried to
[1477.28-1483.52]  receive from Brost, he couldn't do it so Brost and I always worked together. Brost did less talking
[1483.52-1489.60]  than any operator I ever knew. Never having seen him, I went while in New York to call upon him.
[1489.60-1496.08]  I did all the talking. He would listen, stroke his beard and say nothing. In the evening I went over
[1496.08-1502.56]  to an all-night lunch house in the printing house square in a basement, Oliver's. Night editors
[1502.56-1508.72]  included Horace Greeley and Henry Raymond of the New York Times took their midnight lunch there.
[1508.72-1514.32]  When I went with Brost and the other operator they pointed out two or three men who were then
[1514.32-1520.64]  celebrated in the newspaper world. The night was intensely hot and close. After getting our lunch
[1520.64-1526.72]  and upon reaching the sidewalk, Brost opened his mouth and said, that's a great place, a plate of
[1526.72-1533.28]  cakes, a cup of coffee and a Russian bath for ten cents. This was about 50% of his conversation
[1533.28-1539.28]  for two days. The work of Edison on the gold indicator had thrown him into close relationships
[1539.28-1545.68]  with Mr. Franklin L. Pope, the un-telegraph engineer that associated with Dr. Laws and afterward
[1545.68-1551.84]  a distinguished expert at technical writer who became president of the American Institute of Electrical
[1552.00-1558.80]  Engineers in 1886. Each recognized the special ability of the other and barely a week after the famous
[1558.80-1564.40]  events of Black Friday, the announcement of their partnership appeared in the telegrapher of October
[1564.40-1572.48]  1, 1869. This was the first professional card if it may be so described ever issued in America by
[1572.48-1579.52]  a form of electrical engineers and is here reproduced. It is probable that the advertisement, one of the
[1579.52-1586.48]  largest in the telegrapher and appearing frequently, was not paid for at full rates as the publisher
[1586.48-1593.68]  Mr. J. and Ashley became a partner in the firm and not altogether a sleeping one when it came to
[1593.68-1600.00]  the division of profits, which at times were considerable. In order to be near his new friend,
[1600.00-1606.80]  Edison boarded the Pope at Elizabeth, New Jersey for some time, living the strenuous life and the
[1606.80-1612.32]  performance of his duties. Associated with Pope and Ashley, he followed up his work on telegraph
[1612.32-1618.40]  printers with Mark's success. While with them, I devised a printer to print gold quotations instead
[1618.40-1624.64]  of indicating them. The lines were started and the hole was sold out to the gold and stock
[1624.64-1631.36]  telegraph company. My experimenting was all done in that small shop of Dr. Bradley, located near
[1631.36-1637.92]  the station of the Pennsylvania Railroad in New Jersey City. Every night, I left for Elizabeth
[1637.92-1644.32]  on the 1 a.m. train, then walked half a mile to Mr. Pope's house, and up at 6 a.m. for breakfast to
[1644.32-1650.16]  catch the 7 a.m. train. This continued for all winter and many were the occasions when I was
[1650.16-1656.56]  nearly frozen in the Elizabeth walk. This Dr. Bradley appears to have been the first in this country
[1656.56-1662.40]  to make electrical measurements up precision with a galvanometer, but was an old school
[1662.40-1668.32]  experimenter who had worked for years on an experiment without commercial value. He was also
[1668.32-1673.60]  extremely irrascible and went on one occasion, the connecting wire would not come out of one of
[1673.60-1678.96]  the binding posts of a new and costly galvanometer. He jerked the instrument to the floor and then jumped
[1678.96-1685.20]  on it. He must have been, however, a man of originality as evidenced by his attempt to age whiskey
[1685.28-1691.60]  by electricity. In an attempt that has often been made, the hobby he had at the time I was there,
[1691.60-1696.96]  as says Edison, was the aging of raw whiskey by passing strong electric currents through it.
[1697.60-1704.00]  He had arranged 20 jars with platinum electrodes held in place by hard rubber. When I was ready,
[1704.00-1708.80]  he filled the cells with whiskey, connected the battery, locked the door of the small room to
[1708.80-1714.00]  which he had placed, and gave positive orders that no one should enter. He then disappeared for three
[1714.80-1720.24]  days. On the second day, we noticed a terrible smell in the shop as if from some dead animal.
[1720.24-1725.68]  The next day the doctor arrived and noticed the smell asked what was dead. We all thought something
[1725.68-1731.52]  had gotten into his whiskey room and died. He opened it and was nearly overcome. The hard rubber
[1731.52-1737.60]  he used was, of course, full of sulfur, and this being attacked by a nauseous hydrogen had produced
[1737.60-1745.04]  sulfide hydrogen gas in torrents, displacing all the air in the room. Sulfuride hydrogen is,
[1745.04-1750.56]  as well known, the gas given off by rotten eggs. Another glimpse of this period of development
[1750.56-1755.60]  is afforded by an interesting article on the stock reporting telegraph in the electrical world
[1755.60-1762.32]  of March 4, 1899. But Mr. Ralph W. Pope, the well-known secretary of the American Institute of
[1762.32-1767.92]  Electrical Engineers, who had, as a youth, an active and intimate connection with that branch
[1767.92-1772.88]  of the electrical industry. In the course of his article, he mentions the curious fact that Dr.
[1772.88-1779.52]  Law is at first in receiving quotations from the exchanges, was so distrustful of the more system
[1779.52-1784.88]  that he installed long lines of speaking tubes as a more satisfactory and safe device than the
[1784.88-1792.08]  telegraph wires. As to the relations of that time, Mr. Pope remarks, the rivalry between the two
[1792.08-1798.48]  concerns resulted in consolidation. Dr. Law's enterprise being absorbed by the gold and stock
[1798.48-1804.56]  telegraph company, while the Law's stock printer was relegated to the scrap heap and the museum
[1804.56-1812.80]  competition in the field did not, however, cease. Mrs. Pope and Edison invented a one-wayer printer
[1812.80-1818.40]  and started a system of gold printers devoted to the recording of gold quotations and sterling
[1818.40-1825.52]  exchange only. It was intended more specifically for importers and exchange brokers and was furnished
[1825.52-1831.44]  at a lower price than the indicator service. The building and equipment of private telegraph lines
[1831.44-1838.40]  was also entered upon. This business was subsequently absorbed by the gold and stock telegraph company,
[1838.40-1844.48]  which was probably at this time at the height of its prosperity. The financial organization of the
[1844.48-1852.64]  company was peculiar and worthy of attention. Each subscriber for a machine paid in $100 for the
[1852.64-1860.08]  privilege of securing an instrument. For the service, he paid $25 weekly. In case he retired or failed,
[1860.08-1865.68]  he could transfer his right and employees were constantly on the alert for purchasable rights,
[1865.68-1871.44]  which could be disposed of at a profit. It was occasionally worth the profit to convince a man
[1872.00-1877.68]  that he did not actually own the machine which had been placed in his office. The Western Union
[1877.68-1883.76]  telegraph company secured a majority of its stock and General Marshall Lefferetz was elected
[1883.76-1889.52]  president. A private line department was established and the business taken over from Pope Edison
[1889.52-1895.60]  and Ashley was rapidly enlarged. At this juncture, General Lefferetz as president of the gold and
[1895.60-1901.20]  stock telegraph company requested Edison to go to work on improving the stock ticker.
[1901.20-1906.40]  Furnishing the money and the well-known universal ticker in widespread use in this day was one
[1906.40-1912.96]  result. Mr. Edison gives a graphic picture of the startling efforts of his fortunes. I made
[1912.96-1918.72]  a great many inventions. One was the special ticker used for many years outside of New York
[1918.72-1925.04]  in other large cities. This was made exceedingly simple as they did not have the experts we
[1925.04-1930.80]  had in New York to handle anything complicated. The same ticker was used on the London Stock Exchange.
[1931.68-1937.04]  After I had made a great number of inventions and obtained patents, the General seemed anxious
[1937.04-1943.12]  that the matter should be closed up. One day I exhibited and worked on a successful device whereby
[1943.12-1949.04]  if a ticker should get out of Edison in a broker's office and commence to print wild figures,
[1949.04-1953.68]  it could be brought in Unison from the central station, which saved the labor of many men
[1953.68-1957.68]  and much trouble to the broker. He called me into his office and said,
[1958.40-1963.92]  now young man, I want to close up the matter of your inventions. How much do you think you should
[1963.92-1969.92]  receive? I had made up my mind that taking into consideration the time and the killing pace I was
[1969.92-1977.20]  working at, I should be entitled to $5,000 but could get along with $3,000. When the psychological
[1977.20-1983.20]  moment arrived, I hadn't the nerve to name such a large sum. So I said, well General,
[1983.20-1990.00]  suppose you make me offer, then he said, how would $40,000 strike you? This caused me to come
[1990.00-1996.40]  as near-fainting as I had ever got. I was afraid he would hear my heartbeat. I managed to say that I
[1996.40-2003.04]  thought it was fair. All right, I will have a contract drawn, come around in three days and sign it
[2003.04-2008.64]  and I will give you the money. I arrived on time but had been doing some considerable thinking on
[2008.64-2014.80]  the subject. The sum seemed to be very large for the amount of work, for at that time I determined
[2014.80-2021.04]  the value by the time and trouble and not by what the invention was worth to others. I thought
[2021.04-2026.64]  there was something unreal about it. However, the contract was handed to me. I signed without
[2026.64-2033.44]  reading it. Edison was then handed the first check he'd ever received, won for $40,000 drawn on
[2033.44-2039.60]  the bank of New York at the corner of William and Wall Street. I'm going to the bank and passing in
[2039.60-2045.36]  the check of the paying teller. Some brief remarks were made to him, which in his deafness he did not
[2045.36-2052.16]  understand. The check was handed back to him and Edison fencing for a moment that in some way he had
[2052.16-2057.84]  been cheated, went outside to the large steps to let the cold sweaty evaporate. He then went back
[2057.84-2062.88]  to the general who with his secretary had a good laugh over the matter, told him the check must be
[2062.88-2069.28]  endorsed and sent him with a young man to identify him. The ceremony of identification performed with
[2069.28-2074.72]  the paying teller who was quite merry over the incident. Edison was given the amount in bundles
[2074.72-2082.08]  of small bills until there certainly seemed to be a one-cubot foot. Unaware that he was the victor
[2082.08-2087.92]  of a practical joke. Edison proceeded gravely to stole away the money in his overcoat pockets
[2087.92-2092.80]  and all his other pockets. He then went to Newark and sat up all night with a money for fear it might
[2092.80-2098.32]  be stolen. Once more he sought help and exporting when the general laughed heartily and telling the
[2098.32-2103.76]  clerk that the joke must be not carried any further and enabled him to deposit the currency in the
[2103.76-2109.76]  bank and open an account. Thus in an inconceivably brief time had Edison passed from poverty to
[2109.76-2116.88]  independence, made a deep impression as to his originality and ability on important people
[2116.88-2124.08]  and brought out valuable inventions lifting himself at one bound out of the ruck of mediocrity
[2124.08-2130.48]  and away from the deadening treasury of a key. Best of all he was enterprising one of the leaders
[2130.48-2136.40]  and pioneers for whom the world is always looking and to use his own criticism of himself.
[2137.12-2144.32]  He had to sanguine a temperament to keep money in solitary confinement. Quiet self-possession
[2144.32-2149.68]  he seized his opportunity began to buy a machinery, rent it a shop and got to work.
[2150.40-2156.40]  Moving quickly into a larger shop, numbers 10 and 12 Ward Street, Newark, New Jersey,
[2156.40-2162.08]  he secured large orders from general lefritz to build stock tickers and employed 50 men.
[2162.80-2168.24]  As business increased he put on a night force and was his own foreman on both shifts.
[2169.12-2174.72]  Half an hour of sleep three or four times in the 24 hours was all he needed in those days.
[2174.72-2180.16]  When one invention succeeded another with dazzling rapidity and when he worked with the new
[2180.16-2187.12]  fierce eruptive energy of a great volcano throwing out new ideas incessantly with spectacular
[2187.12-2192.96]  effect on the arts to which they related. It has always been a theory with Edison that we need
[2192.96-2199.68]  sleep altogether too much but on the other hand he never until long past 50, new or practiced
[2199.68-2204.80]  the slightest moderation in his work or in the use of strong coffee and black cigars.
[2205.52-2212.40]  He has more over while a tender and kindly disposition never hesitated to use men up as freely
[2212.48-2219.68]  as an Napoleon or Grant, seeing only the goal of a complete invention or perfect device to attain
[2219.68-2225.76]  which all else must become subsidiary. He gives a graphic picture of his first methods as a
[2225.76-2232.72]  manufacturer. Nearly all of my men were on piecework and I allowed them to make good wages and never
[2232.72-2240.64]  cut until the pay became absurdly high as they got more expert. I kept no books. I had two hooks,
[2240.64-2246.40]  all the bills and accounts I owned I jabbed on one hook and the memorandum of all who owed me
[2246.40-2251.92]  I put on the other. When some of the bills fell due and I couldn't deliver tickets to get a supply
[2251.92-2258.00]  of money I gave a note. When the notes were due a messenger came around from the bank with the note
[2258.00-2263.76]  and a protest pinned to it for a dollar twenty five. Then I would go to New York and get an advance
[2263.76-2269.44]  or pay the note if I had the money. This method of giving notes for my accounts and having all notes
[2269.44-2276.08]  protested I kept up for over two years. Yet my credit was fine. Every story I traded with was
[2276.08-2281.76]  always glad to furnish goods. Perhaps an amazed admiration of my system of doing business which
[2281.76-2288.08]  was certainly new. After a while Edison got a bookkeeper who his vagrancies made him look back
[2288.08-2293.52]  with regret on the earlier primitive method. The first three months I had him go over all the books
[2293.52-2299.60]  to find out how much we made. He reported three thousand dollars. I gave a supper to some of my
[2299.60-2305.84]  men to celebrate this only to be told two days afterward they made a mistake and we had lost five
[2305.84-2310.72]  hundred dollars and then a few days after that he came to me again and said he was all mixed up
[2310.72-2317.04]  and now I found we made over seven thousand dollars. Edison changed bookkeepers but never there after
[2317.04-2322.80]  counted anything real profit until he had paid all his debts and had the profits in the bank.
[2322.80-2328.96]  The fact you work at this time related chiefly to stock tickers principally the universal of which at
[2328.96-2335.12]  one time twelve hundred were in use. Edison's connections with this particular device was very close
[2335.12-2342.72]  while it lasted. In a review of the ticker art Mr. Callahan stated with rather grudging praise that
[2342.72-2350.24]  a ticker at the present time 1901 would be considered as impractical and unsalable if it were not
[2350.24-2356.64]  provided with a unison device and he goes on to remark the first unison on stock tickers was
[2356.64-2363.68]  one used on the law's printer but no too. It was a crude and unsatisfactory piece of mechanism
[2363.68-2369.28]  and necessitated doubling of the battery in order to bring it into action. It was short lived.
[2370.00-2377.12]  The Edison unison compromised a lever with a free and traveling unspiral or worm on the
[2377.12-2383.52]  type wheel shaft until it met a pin at the end of the worm thus obstructing the shaft and leaving
[2383.52-2389.36]  the type wheels at the zero point until released by the printing lever. This device is too well
[2389.36-2395.60]  known to require further description. It is not applicable to any instrument using two independently
[2395.60-2402.48]  moving type wheels but on nearly if not all other instruments will be found in use. The stock ticker
[2402.56-2411.44]  has enjoyed the devotion of many brilliant inventors GM Phelps H. Van Hoverberg A. A. Knudsen G. B. Scott
[2412.08-2420.08]  SD Field John Burry and remains an extensive use as an application for which no substitute or
[2420.08-2425.84]  competitor has been found. In New York the two great stock exchanges had deemed it necessary to
[2425.84-2431.20]  own an operating stock ticker service for this whole benefit of their members and down to the
[2431.20-2436.56]  present moment the process of improvement has gone on impelled by the increasing volume of
[2436.56-2442.80]  business to be reported. It is significant of Edison's work now dimmed and overlaid by later
[2442.80-2448.56]  advances than at the very outset he recognized the vital importance of the interchangeability in
[2448.56-2454.96]  the construction of this delicate and sensitive apparatus. But the difficulties of these early days
[2455.20-2462.24]  were almost insurmountable. Mr. R. W. Pope says of the universal machines that they were simple
[2462.24-2468.56]  and substantial and generally satisfactory but adds. These instruments were supposed to have been
[2468.56-2473.76]  made with interchangeable parts but as a matter of fact the instances in which these parts would
[2473.76-2480.40]  fit were very few. The instruction book prepared for the use of the inspector states that the parts
[2480.40-2486.08]  should not be tinkered or bent as they are accurately made and interchangeable. The difficulties
[2486.08-2491.60]  encountered in fitting them properly doubtless gave rise to a story that Mr. Edison had stated there
[2491.60-2497.84]  were three degrees of interchangeability. This was interpreted to mean first the parts will fit,
[2497.84-2504.80]  second they will almost fit, third they do not fit and can't be made to fit. Footnote 2, this
[2504.80-2512.08]  I invented as well, T-A-E. This early shop affords an illustration of the manner in which Edison
[2512.08-2518.48]  has made a deep impression on the personnel of the electrical arts. At a single bench there were
[2518.48-2524.72]  three men since Rich O'Promonett, one with Sigmund Bergman for a time partner with Edison in his
[2524.72-2529.76]  lighting developments in the United States and now head and principal owner of the electrical
[2529.84-2537.60]  works in Berlin employing tens thousand men. The next man adjacent was John Crucy afterward engineer
[2537.60-2544.72]  of the great John L'Electric Works as Connected E. A third was Schuckert who left the bench to settle
[2544.72-2550.48]  up with his father's little estate in Nuremberg stayed there and founded electrical factories which
[2550.48-2557.52]  became the third largest in Germany. Their proprietor died very wealthy. I gave them good training as
[2557.52-2564.48]  to working hours in hustling, says their quadrum master and this is equally true as applies to
[2564.48-2570.00]  many scores of others working in companies bearing Edison's name or organized under Edison
[2570.00-2576.48]  patents. It is curiously sufficient in this connection that of the 21 presidents of the
[2576.48-2582.88]  national society the Americanist should have the electrical engineers founded in 1884,
[2582.88-2590.00]  eight have been intimately associated with Edison. Namely, Norman Green and F. L. Polk as business
[2590.00-2596.64]  colleagues of the days of which we now write while Messer's Frank J. Sprague, T. C. Martin,
[2596.64-2604.56]  A. E. Kenley, SS Wheeler, John W. Leib Jr. and Lewis Ferguson have all been at one time or
[2604.56-2610.96]  another in Edison employ. The remark was once made that if a famous American teacher sat at one
[2610.96-2616.72]  end of a log and a student at the other end the elements of a successful university were present.
[2617.44-2623.12]  It is equally true that in Edison and the many men who have graduated from his Stern School of
[2623.12-2628.00]  Endeavor America has had its foremost seat of electrical engineering.
