[20.24-25.88]  The Case of Elizabeth Canning. Don't let your poor little Lizzie be blamed.
[26.84-31.72]  Everyone has heard of the case of Elizabeth Canning, writes Mr. John Paget,
[31.72-36.92]  until recently I agreed with him. But five or six years ago, the case of Elizabeth Canning
[36.92-42.60]  repeated itself in a marvelous way. And then, but few persons of my acquaintance had ever heard
[42.60-48.84]  of that mysterious girl. The recent case, so strange a parallel to that of 1753,
[48.84-53.72]  was this. In Cheshire, lived a young woman whose business in life was that of a daily
[53.72-58.04]  governess. One Sunday, her family went to church in the morning, but she set off
[58.04-63.48]  to skate by herself on a lonely pond. She was never seen of or heard of, again,
[63.48-68.36]  till in the dusk of the following Thursday, her hat was found outside of the door of her
[68.36-73.48]  father's farm yard. Her friend discovered her further off in a most miserable condition,
[73.48-79.32]  weak, emaciated, and with her skull fractured. Her explanation was that a man had seized her on
[79.40-84.92]  the ice, or as she had left it, had dragged her across the fields and had shed her up in a house,
[84.92-90.04]  from which she escaped, crawled to her father's home, and when she found herself unable to go
[90.04-95.48]  further, tossed her hat towards the farm door. Neither such a man as she described,
[95.48-101.16]  nor the house in which she had been imprisoned were ever found. The girl's character was excellent.
[101.16-106.76]  Nothing pointed to her condition being the result, dune orjie a chevalet. But the neighbors,
[106.76-112.04]  of course, made insinuations, and a lady of my acquaintance who visited the girl's mother,
[112.04-116.28]  found herself almost alone in placing a charitable construction on the adventure.
[117.00-122.36]  My theory was that the girl had fractured her skull by a fall on the ice, had crawled to and
[122.36-127.40]  lain in an unvisited outhouse of the farm, and on that Thursday night was wandering out
[127.40-132.84]  in a distraught state, not wandering in. Her story would be the result of her cerebral
[132.84-137.96]  condition, concussion of the brain. It was while people were discussing this affair,
[137.96-143.08]  a second edition of Elizabeth Cannings, that one found out how forgotten was Elizabeth.
[143.72-150.20]  On January 1st, 1753, Elizabeth was in her 18th year. She was the daughter of a carpenter in
[150.20-155.96]  Alderman Berry. Her mother, who had four younger children, was a widow, very poor and of the best
[155.96-162.52]  character. Elizabeth was short of stature, ruddy of complexion, and owing to an accident in childhood,
[162.52-168.44]  the falling of a Garrett ceiling on her head, was subject to fits of unconsciousness on any alarm.
[168.44-174.20]  On learning this, the mind flies to hysteria, with its accompaniment of diabolical falseness,
[174.20-179.80]  for an explanation of her adventure. But hysteria does not serve the turn. The girl had been
[179.80-185.08]  four years in service with a Mr. Wintelberry, a publican. He gave her the highest character for
[185.08-190.28]  honesty and reserve. She did not attend to the customers at the bar, she kept to herself,
[190.28-194.60]  she had no young man, and she only left Wintelberries for a better place.
[194.60-199.48]  At a Mr. Lyons, a near neighbor of her mother. Lyon, a carpenter, corroborated,
[199.48-202.84]  as did all the neighbors, on the points of modesty and honesty.
[203.64-210.36]  On New Year's Day 1753, Elizabeth wore her holiday best, a purple masquerade stuffed gown,
[210.36-215.00]  a white handkerchief in apron, a black quilted pedicote, a green undercoat,
[215.00-220.12]  black shoes, blue stockings, a white shaving hat with green ribbons, and a very
[220.12-226.04]  ruddy color. She had her wages or Christmas box in her pocket, a golden half guinea in a little
[226.04-231.48]  box, with three shillings and a few coppers, including a farthing. The pants she gave to three of
[231.48-236.20]  her little brothers and sisters. One boy, however, had huffed her and got no penny.
[236.68-242.44]  But she relented, and when she went out, bought for him a mince pie. Her visit of New Year's Day
[242.52-248.60]  was to her maternal aunt, Mrs. Colley, living at Salt Peter Bank, Dock Street behind the London
[248.60-254.52]  Dock. She meant to return in time to buy with her mother a cloak, but the Colley's had a cold,
[254.52-261.56]  early dinner, and kept her till about 9pm for a hot supper. Already at 9pm, Mr. Lyon had sent
[261.56-266.68]  to Mrs. Cannings to make inquiries. The girl was not want to stay out so late on a holiday.
[267.32-272.28]  About 9pm, in fact, the two Colley's were escorting Elizabeth as far as Houndstitch.
[272.60-279.16]  The rest is mystery. On Elizabeth's non-arrival, Mrs. Canning sent her lad a little after 10
[279.16-284.84]  to the Colley's, who were in bed. The night was passed in anxious search to know a veil.
[284.84-290.28]  By six in the morning, inquiries were vainly renewed. Weeks went by. Mrs. Canning,
[290.28-295.48]  aided by the neighbors, advertised in the papers, mentioning a report of shrieks heard from a
[295.48-302.12]  coach in Bishop's Gate Street in the small morning hours of January 2nd. The mother, a church woman,
[302.12-307.88]  had prayers put up at several churches, and at Mr. Wesley's chapel. She also consulted a cheap
[307.88-314.28]  wise man, whose aspect alarmed her, but whose wisdom took the form of advising her to go on advertising.
[314.76-320.12]  It was later rumored that he said the girl was in the hands of an old black woman and would return,
[320.12-325.48]  but Mrs. Canning admitted nothing of all this. Skeptics, with their usual cuteness,
[325.48-330.28]  maintained that the disappearance was meant to stimulate charity, and that the girl knew where the
[330.28-335.56]  daughter was, or on the other hand, the daughter had fled to give birth to a child in secret,
[335.56-341.00]  or for another reason incident to the young and gay, as one of the council employed euphemistically
[341.00-347.00]  put the case. The medical evidence did not confirm these suggestions. Details are needless,
[347.00-352.20]  but these theories were certainly improbable. The character of La Pousseau was not more stainless
[352.20-359.08]  than Elizabeth's. About 1015 pm on January 29th, on the eve of the martyrdom of King Charles,
[359.16-364.60]  as the poor women dated it, Mrs. Canning was on her knees praying, so said her apprentice,
[364.60-370.36]  that she might be hold even if it were but an apparition of her daughter. Such was her daily prayer.
[370.36-375.88]  It was, as in words worth, a fliction of Margaret. I look for ghosts, but none will force their way
[375.88-380.84]  to me. Tis falsely said that ever there was intercourse between the living and the dead.
[381.56-387.16]  At that moment, there was a sound at the door. The apprentice opened it and was a guest. The mother's
[387.16-393.64]  prayer seemed to be answered. For there, bleeding, bowed double, livid, ragged, with a cloth about
[393.64-399.40]  her head and clad in a dirty dressing jacket and a filthy, draggled pedicote was Elizabeth Canning.
[399.40-403.80]  She had neglected her little brother that huffed her on New Year's Day, but she had been thinking
[403.80-409.72]  of him, and now she gave her mother for him all that she had, the farthing. You see that I am on
[409.72-415.88]  Elizabeth's side. That farthing touch, and another with the piety, honesty, loyalty, and even the
[415.88-421.40]  superstition of her people, have made me her partisan, as was Mr. Henry Fielding, the well-known
[421.40-428.44]  magistrate. Some friends were sent for Mrs. Myers, Ms. Polly Lyon, daughter of her master, and others,
[428.44-433.80]  while busy bodies flocked in, among them one Robert Scarrett, a toiler who had no personal
[433.80-438.52]  knowledge of Elizabeth. A little wine was mold. The girl could not swallow it, and may she
[438.52-444.28]  ate it as she was. Her condition need not be described in detail, but she was very near her death,
[444.28-449.48]  as the medical evidence, and that of a midwife, who consoled Mrs. Canning on one point,
[449.48-456.04]  proves beyond possibility of cable. The girl told her story, but what did she tell? Mr. Austin
[456.04-461.64]  Dobson, in the Dictionary of National Biography, says that her tale gradually took shape under
[461.64-467.00]  the questions of sympathizing neighbors. And certainly on some points, she gave affirmative answers
[467.00-472.28]  to leading questions asked by Robert Scarrett. The difficulty is that the neighbors' accounts of
[472.28-477.48]  what Elizabeth said in her woeful condition were given when the girl was tried for perjury in
[477.48-484.60]  April May 1754. We must therefore make allowance for friendly bias and mythopoic memory. On
[484.60-491.56]  January 31st, 1753, Elizabeth made her statement before Alderman Chitty, and the chief count against
[491.56-498.12]  her is that what she told Chitty did not tally with what the neighbors in May 1754 swore that she
[498.20-505.72]  told them when she came home on January 29th 1753. This point is overlooked by Mr. Paget in his essay
[505.72-512.52]  on the subject. On the other hand, by 1754, the town was divided into two factions, believers and
[512.52-518.28]  disbelievers in Elizabeth, and Chitty was them a disbeliever. Chitty took but a few notes on January
[518.28-524.92]  31st 1753. I did not make it so distinct as I could wish, not thinking it could be the subject
[524.92-531.96]  of so much inquiry he admitted in 1754. Moreover, the notes which he then produced were not the notes
[531.96-539.08]  which he made at the time, but what I took since from that paper I took then. January 31st 1753
[539.08-544.52]  of hers and other persons that were brought before me. This is not intelligible and it is not
[544.52-551.56]  satisfactory. If Elizabeth handed in a paper, Chitty should have produced it in 1754. If he took
[551.64-558.44]  notes of the evidence, why did he not produce the original notes? These notes made when and from
[558.44-565.00]  what source is vague, bear that Elizabeth's tale was this. At a dead wall by Bedlam in Morefields
[565.00-573.00]  about 10pm on January 1st 1753, two men stripped her of gown, apron and hat, robbed her of 13
[573.00-578.76]  shillings and six pence, struck her, stunned her, and pushed her along Bishop's Gate Street.
[578.76-583.72]  She lost consciousness, one of her fits, and recovered herself near Enfield Wash.
[584.44-590.12]  Here she was taken to a house later said to be Mother Wells's, where several persons were.
[590.68-597.16]  Chitty and luckily does not say what sort of persons, and on that point all turns. She was asked
[597.16-602.68]  to do as they did. A woman forced her upstairs into a room and cut the lace of her stays,
[602.68-607.00]  told her they were bread and water in the room, and that her throat would be cut if she came out.
[607.00-612.28]  The door was locked on her. There was no lock, the door was merely bolted. She lived on fragments
[612.28-617.00]  of a quarter in loaf and water in a pitcher, with the mince pie bought for her naughty little brother.
[617.56-623.88]  She escaped about four in the afternoon of January 29th. In the room were an old stooler too,
[623.88-630.68]  an old picture over the chimney, two windows, an old table and so on. She forced a pain in a window
[630.68-636.84]  and got out on a small shed of boards or penthouse, and so slid to the ground. She did not say the
[636.84-642.12]  alderman added that there was any hay in the room. Of bread there were four or five or five or
[642.12-647.96]  six pieces. She never mentioned to the name of Wells. Someone else did that at a venture.
[647.96-652.28]  She said she could tell nothing of the woman's name. The alderman issued a warrant against
[652.28-658.20]  this Mrs. Wells, apparently on newspaper suggestion. The chief points against Elizabeth were that
[658.20-664.04]  when Wells's place was examined, there was no penthouse to aid an escape and no old picture.
[664.04-669.24]  But under a wretched kind of bed supporting the thing was a picture on wood of a crown.
[669.24-675.64]  Madame Wells had at one time used this loyal emblem as a sign. She keeping a very ill-famed house of
[675.64-682.04]  call. But in December 1745, when certain Highland and Lowland gentlemen were accompanying
[682.04-687.64]  Bonnie Prince Charlie towards the metropolis, Mrs. Wells removed into a room the picture of the
[687.64-693.48]  crown as being apt to cause political emotions. This sign may have been the old picture.
[693.56-697.96]  As to hay, there was hay in the room later searched, but penthouse there was none.
[698.76-703.72]  That is the worst point in the alderman's notes of whatever value these enigmatic documents
[703.72-710.28]  may be held. One Nash, butler to the Goldsmiths company, was present at the examination before
[710.28-719.64]  Chitty on January 31st, 1753. He avert in May 1754 what Chitty did not. The Elizabeth spoke of
[719.64-725.08]  the place of her imprisonment as a little square, darkest room with a few old pictures.
[725.80-731.16]  Here the one old picture of the notes is better evidence if the notes are evidence than Nash's
[731.16-737.24]  memory. But I find that he was harping on a few old pictures as early as March 1753.
[737.88-743.08]  Elizabeth said she hurt her ear in getting out of the window, and in fact it was freshly cut and
[743.08-749.40]  bleeding when she arrived at home. All of this Nash is so far the better evidence as the next day
[749.64-756.28]  February 1st, 1753, one of most tumultuous popular investigation of the supposed house of
[756.28-762.84]  captivity was made. He says that he and others, finding the dungeon not to be square, small,
[762.84-768.60]  and darkish, but a long narrow slit of a loft, half full of hay, expressed disbelief.
[768.60-773.64]  Yet it was proved that he went on suggesting to Lyon, a Elizabeth's master, that people should
[773.80-779.88]  give money to Elizabeth and wish him success. The proof was a letter of his dated February 10th,
[779.88-787.16]  1753. Also, Nash and two like-minded friends, hearing Elizabeth purge herself as they thought
[787.16-792.92]  at the trial of Mrs. Wells, whom Elizabeth never mentioned to Chitty, did not give evidence against
[792.92-799.80]  her, on the most absurdly flimsy excuses. One man was so horrified that in place of denouncing
[799.88-805.32]  the perjury he fled incontinent, another went to a dinner and Nash to goldsmiths hall to his
[805.32-811.56]  duties as butler. Such was then the vigor of their skepticism. On the other hand, at the trial
[811.56-817.80]  in 1754, the neighbors reported Elizabeth's tale as told on the night when she came home more dead
[817.80-824.20]  than alive. Mrs. Myers had known Elizabeth for 11 years, a very sober honest girl as any in
[825.00-830.60]  England. Mrs. Myers found her livid, her fingers stood crooked. Mrs. Canning, Mrs. Woodward,
[830.60-836.36]  and Polly Lyon were then present, and Mrs. Myers knelt beside Elizabeth to hear her story.
[836.36-842.12]  It was as Chitty gave it to the point where she was carried into a house. The several persons there,
[842.12-847.64]  she said, were an elderly woman and two young ones. Her stays were cut by the old woman.
[847.64-853.96]  She was then thrust upstairs into a room wherein was hay, a pitcher of water, and bread in pieces.
[854.12-859.64]  Bread may have been brought in, water too, while she slept. A point never mentioned in the trials.
[859.64-867.24]  She heard the name of Mother Will's or Wells mentioned. Now, Scarrett in 1754 said that he,
[867.24-874.28]  being present on January 29, 1753, and hearing of the house, offered to bet a guinea to a far
[874.28-879.48]  thing that it was Mother Wells's. But Mrs. Myers believed that Elizabeth had mentioned hearing
[879.72-885.08]  that name earlier. And Mrs. Myers must have heard Scarrett, if he suggested it, before Elizabeth
[885.08-891.00]  named it. The point is uncertain. Mrs. Woodward was in Mrs. Canning's room a quarter of an hour
[891.00-895.64]  after Elizabeth's arrival. The girl said she was almost starved to death in a house on the
[895.64-900.68]  Hertfordshire Road, which she knew by seeing the Hertford Coach, with which she was familiar,
[900.68-906.60]  go by. The woman who cut her stays was a tall, black, swarthy woman. Scarrett said that was not
[906.60-912.28]  Mrs. Wells, which was fair on Scarrett's part. Elizabeth described the two young women as being
[912.28-918.44]  one fair, the other dark, so Scarrett swore. Wintelbury, her old master, and several others corroborated.
[919.16-925.00]  If these accounts by Mrs. Myers, Mrs. Woodward, Scarrett, Wintelbury, and others are trustworthy,
[925.00-930.60]  then Elizabeth Canning's narrative is true. For she found the two girls, the tall, swarthy woman,
[930.60-935.88]  the hay, and the broken water pitcher, and almost everything else that she had mentioned on January 29th
[935.88-941.24]  at Mother Wells's house, when it was visited on February 1st. But we must remember that most
[941.24-947.80]  accounts of what Elizabeth said on January 29th and on January 31st are 15 months after date and
[947.80-954.44]  are biased on both sides. To Mother Wells's, the girl was taken on February 1st in what a company.
[954.44-961.24]  The coach or cab was crammed full, some friends walked, several curious citizens rode, and when Elizabeth
[961.24-966.44]  arrived at the house, Nash, the butler, and other busy bodies had made a descent on it.
[966.44-972.60]  The officer with the warrant was already there. Lion, Aldridge, and Hague were with Nash in a cab,
[972.60-977.40]  and were met by others riding hard, who had seized the people found at Mrs. Wells's.
[977.40-982.68]  There was a rabble of persons on foot and on horse about the door. On entering the doorway,
[982.68-987.72]  the parlor was to your left, the house staircase in front of you. On your right the kitchen,
[988.28-993.00]  at the further end, thereof was a door, and when that was opened, a flight of stairs
[993.00-999.32]  led to a long slit of a loft, which Nash later declared did not answer to Elizabeth's description,
[999.32-1004.28]  especially as there was hay, and before Chidi, Elizabeth had mentioned none.
[1004.28-1009.64]  There was a filthy kind of bed on which now slept a laborer and his wife, fortune and judith
[1009.64-1016.04]  needis. Nash kept talking about the hay, and one Adamson rode to meet Elizabeth and came back saying
[1016.12-1022.12]  that she said there was hay. By Adamson's account, he only asked her what kind of place was it,
[1022.12-1027.64]  and she said a wild kind of place with hay in it, as in the neighbor's version of her first narrative,
[1027.64-1030.76]  Mrs. Myers, who was in the coach, corroborated Adamson.
[1031.88-1037.32]  The point of the skeptics was that till Adamson rode back to her on her way to Wells's house,
[1037.32-1042.28]  she had never mentioned hay. They argued that Adamson had asked her was there hay in the room,
[1042.28-1048.76]  and that she taking the hint had said yes. By May 1754, Adamson and Mrs. Myers,
[1048.76-1053.64]  who was in the cab with Elizabeth, would believe that Adamson had asked what kind of place is it,
[1053.64-1059.40]  and that Elizabeth then spoke without suggestion of the hay. The point would be crucial,
[1059.40-1066.04]  but nobody in 1754 appears to have remembered that on February 21, three weeks after the event
[1066.12-1072.76]  at the trial of Mother Wells, Adamson had given exactly the same evidence as in May 1754.
[1072.76-1077.96]  I returned to meet her and asked her about the room. She described to the room with some hay in it,
[1077.96-1084.36]  an odd sort of an empty room. Arriving at Mother Wells's, Elizabeth, very faint, was born in and
[1084.36-1089.72]  set on a dresser in the kitchen. Why did she not at once say my room was up the stairs beyond the
[1089.72-1094.52]  door at the further end of the room? I know not unless she was dazed as well she might be.
[1095.32-1100.68]  Next she, with a mob of the curious, was carried into the parlor, where were all the inmates of
[1100.68-1106.04]  the house. She paid no attention to Mrs. Wells, but at once picked out a tall old woman
[1106.04-1111.72]  huddled over the fire smoking a pipe. She did this by the skeptical Nash's evidence,
[1111.72-1117.32]  instantly, and without hesitation. The old woman rose. She was tall and swarthy,
[1117.32-1123.08]  a gypsy, and according to all witnesses, inconceivably hideous. Her underlip was the size of a
[1123.16-1128.12]  small child's arm, and she was marked with some disease. Pray, look at this face, she said,
[1128.12-1134.44]  I think God never made such another. She was named Mary Squires. She added that on January 1st,
[1134.44-1141.32]  she was in Dorset, at Abbott's Barry, set her son George, who was present. In 1754, 36 people
[1141.32-1146.60]  testified to Mary Squires' presence in Dorset, or to meeting her on her way to London,
[1146.60-1152.28]  while 27, at Enfield alone, swore as positively that they had seen her and her daughter,
[1152.28-1158.68]  at or near Mrs. Wells's, and had conversed with her between December 18th, 1752 and the middle
[1158.68-1164.28]  of January. Some of the Enfield witnesses were of a more prosperous and educated class than the
[1164.28-1170.84]  witnesses for the gypsy. Many on both sides had been eager to swear, indeed many had made affidavits
[1170.84-1178.84]  as early as March 1753. This business of the cross-swearing is absolutely inexplicable. On both sides,
[1178.84-1184.04]  the same entire certainty was exhibited as a rule, yet the woman was unmistakable as she
[1184.04-1190.36]  justly remarked. The gypsy, at all events, had her alibi ready at once. Her denial was as prompt
[1190.36-1195.80]  and unhesitating as Elizabeth's accusation, but if guilty, she had enjoyed plenty of time since
[1195.80-1201.80]  the girl's escape to think out her line of defense. If guilty, it was wiser to alleged an alibi,
[1201.80-1207.48]  than to decamp when Elizabeth made off, for she could not hope to escape pursuit. George Squires,
[1207.56-1214.92]  her son, was so prompt with his at Abbotsbury on January 1st, could not tell in May 1754
[1214.92-1220.28]  where he had passed the Christmas Day before that New Year's Day, and Christmas is a notable day.
[1220.28-1225.80]  Elizabeth also recognized in Lucy Squires, the gypsy's daughter, and in Virtue Hall,
[1225.80-1231.40]  the two girls, dark and fair, who were present when her stays were cut. After the recognition,
[1231.40-1236.04]  Elizabeth was carried through the house, and according to Nash, in the loft up the stairs from
[1236.04-1241.32]  the kitchen, she said in answer to his question, this is the room for here's the hay I lay upon,
[1241.32-1246.12]  but I think there's more of it. She also identified the pitcher with the broken mouth,
[1246.12-1251.24]  which she certainly mentioned to Chitty, as that which held her allowance of water. A chest or
[1251.24-1256.28]  nest of drawers, she declared that she did not remember, and attempt was made to suggest that one
[1256.28-1261.56]  of her party brought the pitcher in with him to confirm her account. This attempt failed,
[1261.64-1268.76]  but that she had mentioned the pitcher was admitted. Mrs. Myers in May 1754 quoted Elizabeth Swords
[1268.76-1274.68]  as to their being more hay, exactly in the terms of Nash. Mrs. Myers was present in the loft,
[1274.68-1280.36]  and added that Elizabeth took her foot and put the hay away and showed the gentleman two holes
[1280.36-1285.64]  and said they were in the room when she was in it before. On February 7th, Elizabeth swore to
[1285.64-1291.40]  her narrative, formally made out by her solicitor, before the author of Tom Jones, and Mr.
[1291.40-1296.84]  Fielding, by threats of prosecution if she kept on shuffling, induced Virtue Hall to corroborate
[1296.84-1302.52]  after she had vexed his kind heart by endless pervert occasions. But as Virtue Hall was later
[1302.52-1309.16]  got at by the other side and recanted, we leave her evidence on one side. On February 21st through
[1309.16-1314.92]  26th, Mary Squires was tried at the Old Bailey and condemned to death, Virtue Hall corroborating
[1314.92-1320.84]  Elizabeth. Mrs. Wells was branded on the hand. Three dorset witnesses to the Gypsies alibi were
[1320.84-1327.56]  not credited, and Fortune and Judith Natus did not appear in court, though subpoenaed. In 1754,
[1327.56-1333.48]  they accounted for this by their fear of the mob. The three skeptics, Nash, Hague, and Aldridge
[1333.48-1338.92]  held their peace. The Lord Mayor, Sir Crispin Gascoin, who was on the bench at the trial of
[1338.92-1345.16]  Squires and Wells, was dissatisfied. He secured many affidavits which seemed unimpeachable for the
[1345.16-1351.00]  Gypsies alibi and so did the other side for her presence at Enfield. He also got at Virtue Hall,
[1351.00-1357.56]  or rather a skeptical Dr. Hill got at her and handed her over to Gascoin. She, as we saw, recanted.
[1357.56-1363.32]  George Squires, the Gypsies son, with an attorney, worked up the evidence for the Gypsies alibi.
[1363.40-1370.36]  She received a free pardon, and on April 29, 1754, they began the trial of Elizabeth Canning
[1370.36-1375.08]  for willful and corrupt perjury. Mr. Davy, opening for the crown,
[1375.08-1379.72]  charitably suggested that Elizabeth had absconded to preserve her character,
[1379.72-1385.72]  and had told a romantic story to raise money. And having by this time subdued all remains of Virtue,
[1385.72-1390.92]  she preferred the offer of money, though she must wade through innocent blood that of the Gypsies
[1391.40-1396.44]  to attain it. These hypotheses are absurd. Her character certainly needed no saving.
[1397.16-1401.80]  Mr. Davy then remarked on the gross improbabilities of the story of Elizabeth.
[1401.80-1408.28]  They are glaring, but as Fielding said, so are the improbabilities of the facts. Somebody had stripped
[1408.28-1413.16]  and starved and imprisoned the girl. That is absolutely certain. She was brought within an
[1413.16-1418.44]  inch of her life. She did not suffer all these things to excite compassion. That is out of the
[1418.44-1424.44]  question. Had she plunged into gayity on New Year's night, the consequences would be other than
[1424.44-1430.20]  instant starvation. They might have been guilty splendor. She had been most abominably misused,
[1430.20-1435.80]  and it was to the last degree improbable that any mortal should so misuse and honest quiet less.
[1436.44-1443.16]  But the grossly improbable had certainly occurred. It was next to impossible that in 1856,
[1443.16-1448.36]  a respectable looking man should offer to take a little boy for a drive, and that six weeks later
[1448.36-1453.56]  the naked body of the boy, who had been starved to death, should be found in a ditch near actin.
[1453.56-1459.16]  But the facts occurred. To squires and wells, a rosy girl might prove more valuable than a little
[1459.16-1465.24]  boy to anybody. That Elizabeth could live for a month on a loaf did not surprise Mrs. Canning.
[1465.24-1470.44]  When things were very hard with her, said Mrs. Canning, the child had lived on half a roll a day.
[1470.44-1475.96]  This is the other touch, which, with the story of the farthing, helps to make me a partisan of Elizabeth.
[1476.20-1483.16]  Mr. Davy said that on January 31st, before Chitty, Elizabeth did not pretend to certainty about
[1483.16-1490.04]  Mrs. Wells. She never did at any time. She neither knew nor affected to know anything about Mrs. Wells.
[1490.60-1496.28]  She had only seen a tall, swarthy woman, a dark girl and a fair girl whom she recognized in the
[1496.28-1501.48]  gypsy, her daughter, and virtue hall. Mr. Davy preferred Nash's evidence to that of all the
[1501.48-1507.24]  neighbors, and even to Chitty's notes, when Nash and Chitty varied. Mr. Davy said that Nash
[1507.24-1512.60]  withdrew his assistance after the visit to the house. It was proved, we saw, by his letter
[1512.60-1518.52]  of February 10th, that he did not withdraw his assistance, which, like that of Mr. Tracy Tutman,
[1518.52-1523.96]  took the form of hoping that other people would subscribe money. Certain varieties of statement
[1523.96-1529.72]  asked the time when Elizabeth finished the water, proved fatal. And the penthouse of Chitty's notes
[1529.72-1535.16]  was played for all that it was worth. It was alleged, as matter of fact, that Adamson brought the
[1535.16-1541.56]  broken picture into the house, this by Mr. Wells later solicitor general. Now, for three months before
[1541.56-1547.88]  February 1st, Adamson had not seen Elizabeth canning, nor had he heard her description of the room.
[1547.88-1553.08]  He was writing, and could not carry a gallon picture in his coat pocket. He could not carry it in
[1553.08-1557.80]  John Gilpin's fashion, and whatever else was denied, it was admitted that from the first,
[1557.80-1563.08]  Elizabeth mentioned the picture. The statement of Mr. Wells that Adamson brought in the picture
[1563.08-1568.28]  was one that no barrister should have made. The Natus pair were now brought in to say that they
[1568.28-1573.32]  slept in the loft during the time that Elizabeth said that she was there, as a reason for not giving
[1573.32-1579.48]  evidence at the Gypsy's trial they alleged fear of the mob, as we saw. The witnesses for the Gypsy's
[1579.48-1585.56]  alibi were called. Mrs. Hopkins of South Parrot dorset was not very confident that she has seen the
[1585.56-1593.48]  Gypsy at her end on December 29th, 1752. She, if Mary Squires she was, told Mrs. Hopkins that they
[1593.48-1601.32]  sold hardware. In fact, they sold software, smuggled Nanking and other stops. Alice Farnham recognized
[1601.32-1606.68]  the Gypsies whom she had seen after new Christmas, new style. They said that they would come see me after
[1606.68-1613.16]  the old Christmas holidays, which is unlikely. Lucy Squires, the daughter, was clean, well dressed,
[1613.16-1619.96]  and tested Mr. Davie she was pretty. She was not called. George Squires was next examined. He had
[1619.96-1626.36]  been well-todored as to what he did after December 29th, but could not tell where he was on Christmas
[1626.36-1631.96]  Day four days earlier. His memory only existed from the hour when he arrived at Mrs. Hopkins Inn
[1631.96-1639.96]  at South Parrot, December 29th, 1752. His own council must have been amazed, but in cross-examination,
[1639.96-1646.84]  Mr. Morton showed that for all time, up to December 29th, 1752, George's memory was an outer
[1646.84-1653.24]  blank. On January 1st, George dined, he said at Abbott's Berry, with one Clark, a sweetheart of
[1653.24-1659.48]  his sister. They had two boiled fouls, but Clark said they had only a part of a foul between them.
[1659.48-1664.12]  There was such a discrepancy of evidence here as to time on the part of one of the Gypsy's
[1664.12-1670.76]  witnesses, that Mr. Davie told him he was drunk. Yet he persisted that he kissed Lucy Squires
[1670.76-1676.68]  at an hour when Lucy to suit the case could not have been present. There was documentary evidence,
[1676.68-1684.36]  a letter of Lucy to Clark from Basingstoke. It was dated January 18th, 1753, but the figure after
[1684.36-1691.08]  175 was torn off the postmark. That was the only injury to the letter. Had there not been a battalion
[1691.08-1698.76]  of as hard swearers to the presence of the Gypsies at Enfield in December, January 1752, 1753,
[1698.76-1703.80]  as there was to their absence from Enfield and to their presence in Dorset, the Gypsy party would
[1703.80-1708.60]  approve to their case. As matters stand, we must remember that the Dorset evidence have been
[1708.60-1714.12]  organized by a solicitor, that the route was one which the Squires party habitually used,
[1714.12-1719.88]  that by the confession of Mr. Davie, the prosecuting council, the Squires family stood in with
[1719.88-1725.80]  the smuggling interest, compact and unscrupulous. They were Gypsies dealing in smuggled goods,
[1725.80-1730.84]  said Mr. Davie. Again, while George Squires had been taught his lesson like a parrot,
[1730.84-1737.64]  the prosecution dared not call his sister pretty Lucy as a witness. They said that George was stupid,
[1737.64-1743.00]  but that Lucy was much more dull. The more stupid was George, the less unlikely was he to kidnap
[1743.00-1749.48]  Elizabeth Canning as a prize of war after robbing her, but she did not swear to him. As to the presence
[1749.48-1755.24]  of the Gypsies that Mrs. Wells is at Enfield, as early as January 19, Mrs. Howard swore.
[1755.24-1760.28]  Her husband lived on his own property and her house with a well, which she allowed the villagers to
[1760.28-1766.20]  use, was opposite Mrs. Wells's. Mrs. Howard had seen the Gypsy girl at the well, and had been
[1766.20-1772.20]  curtsy to by her, at a distance of three or four yards. She had heard earlier from her servants of
[1772.20-1778.44]  the arrival of the Gypsies, and had looked wishfully or earnestly at them. She was not so positive as
[1778.44-1784.60]  to Mary Squires, whom she had seen at a greater distance. William Headland swore to seeing Mary
[1784.60-1791.00]  Squires on January 9. He fixed the date by a market day. Also on the 12th, he saw her and Mrs.
[1791.00-1797.08]  Wells's house. He picked up a bloodstained piece of thin lead under the window from which Elizabeth
[1797.08-1802.92]  escaped, and took it to his mother who corroborated. Samuel's story, who knew Mary Squires from
[1803.08-1809.72]  old, saw her on December 22 in White Web's Lane, so called from the old house noted as a meeting
[1809.72-1816.44]  place of the gun plowter plot conspirators. Story was a retired clockmaker. Mr. Smith, a tenant of
[1816.44-1823.56]  the Duke of Portland, saw Mary Squires in his cowhouse on December 15, 1752. She wanted leave to
[1823.56-1829.56]  camp there as she had done in other years. The Gypsies then lost a pony. Several witnesses
[1829.56-1835.88]  swore to this, and one swore to conversations with Mary Squires about the pony. She gave her name
[1835.88-1842.44]  and said that it was on the clog by which the beast was tethered. Loomworth Dane swore to Mary Squires,
[1842.44-1847.16]  whom he had observed so closely as to note a great hole in the heel of her stocking.
[1847.16-1854.12]  The date was Old Christmas Day, 1752. Dane was landlord of the bell at Enfield, and a maker of
[1854.20-1861.08]  horse collars. Sarah Star, whose house was next to Mrs. Wells's, saw Mary Squires in her own house
[1861.08-1867.24]  on January 18, 19th. Mary wanted to buy pork, and hung about for three quarters of an hour,
[1867.24-1872.60]  offering to tell fortunes. Mrs. Star got rid of her by a present of some pigs flesh.
[1872.60-1878.36]  She fixed to the date by a document which she had given to Miles, a solicitor. It was not in court.
[1878.36-1883.88]  James Pratt swore to talk with Mary Squires before Christmas as to her lost pony. She had then
[1883.88-1888.20]  a man with her. He was asked to look around the court to see if the man was present,
[1888.20-1893.80]  where on George Squires ducked his head and was rebuked by the prosecuting council. Mr. Davey,
[1893.80-1898.36]  who said, it does not look well. It was hardly the demeanor of conscious innocence.
[1899.08-1904.36]  But Pratt would not swear to him. Mary Squires told Pratt that she would consult a cunning man
[1904.36-1910.28]  about the lost pony, and Mr. Nares foolishly asked why a cunning woman should consult a cunning man.
[1910.28-1915.64]  One black fellow will often tell you he can and does something magical, whilst all the time he
[1915.64-1920.60]  is perfectly aware that he cannot, and yet firmly believes that some other man can really do it.
[1921.24-1927.32]  So right, measures Spencer and Gillen in their excellent book on the native tribes of central Australia,
[1927.32-1931.96]  and so it was with the Gypsy, who, though a wise woman, believed in a wise man.
[1932.84-1937.96]  This witness, Pratt, said with great emphasis, upon my oath, that is the woman.
[1937.96-1941.88]  I am positive in my conscience, and I am sure that it was no other woman.
[1941.88-1947.00]  This is the woman I saw at that blessed time. Moreover, she gave him her name as the name on the
[1947.00-1952.44]  clog of the lost pony. The affair of the pony was just what would impress a man like Pratt,
[1952.44-1956.84]  and on the Gypsy's own version, they had no pony with them in their march from Dorset.
[1957.48-1963.24]  All this occurred before Pratt left his house, which was on December 22nd, three days before
[1963.24-1968.76]  new Christmas. He then left Enfield for Chess Hunt, and his evidence carries conviction.
[1968.76-1974.12]  In some other cases, witnesses were very stupid. One could not tell on what month Christmas fell.
[1974.68-1980.36]  One witness, an old woman, made an error, confusing January 16th with January 23rd,
[1980.36-1986.04]  a document on which she relied, gave the later date. If witnesses on either side were a year
[1986.04-1991.00]  out in their reckoning, the discrepancies would be accountable. But Pratt, for example,
[1991.00-1995.56]  could not forget when he left Enfield for Chess Hunt, and farmer Smith and Mrs. Howard
[1995.56-2000.60]  could be under no such confusion of memory. It may be prejudice, but I rather prefer the
[2000.60-2006.28]  Enfield evidence in some ways, as did Mr. Paget. In others, the Dorset evidence seems better.
[2006.92-2011.80]  Elizabeth had sworn to having asked a man to point out the way to London after she escaped into
[2011.80-2019.40]  the lane beside Mrs. Wells's house. A man, Thomas Bennett, swore that on January 29th, 1753,
[2019.40-2024.68]  a miserable poor wretch about half-pest for near the 10-mile stone in a lane. She asked
[2024.68-2030.12]  her way to London. She said she was afraid by the Tanner's dog. The Tanner's house was about
[2030.12-2036.20]  200 yards nearer London, and the prosecution made much of this, as if a dog, with plenty of
[2036.20-2041.64]  leisure and a few against tramps, could not move 200 yards or much more if he were taking a walk
[2041.64-2047.40]  abroad to combat the object of his dislike. Bennett knew that the dog was the Tanner's. Probably,
[2047.40-2052.68]  he saw the dog when he met the Wayfarer, and it does not follow that the Wayfarer herself called
[2052.68-2058.20]  it the Tanner's dog. Bennett fixed the date with precision. Four days later, hearing of the trouble
[2058.20-2062.84]  at Mrs. Wells's, Bennett said, I will be hanged if I did not meet the young woman near this place
[2062.84-2068.28]  and told her the way to London. Mr. Davy could only combat Bennett by laying stress on the Wayfarer's
[2068.28-2073.72]  talking of the Tanner's dog. But the dog, at the moment of the meeting, was probably well in view.
[2073.80-2078.84]  Bennett knew him, and Bennett was not asked, did the woman call the dog the Tanner's dog,
[2078.84-2083.80]  or do you say this of your own knowledge? Moreover, the Tanner was well in view,
[2083.80-2089.64]  and the hound may have conspicuously started from that base of operations. Mr. Davy's reply was
[2089.64-2095.80]  acquibble. His closing speech merely took up the old line. Elizabeth was absent to conceal a
[2095.80-2101.96]  misfortune. Her cunning mother was her accomplice. There was no proof of Elizabeth's unchastity.
[2101.96-2107.40]  Nay, she had an excellent character, but there is a time, gentlemen, when people begin to be wicked.
[2108.12-2113.88]  If engaged for the other side, Mr. Davy would have placed his nemo-repente fruit to PC-MIS.
[2114.52-2119.48]  No person of unblemished character wades straight into innocent blood to use his own phrase.
[2120.20-2125.48]  The recorder summed up against Elizabeth. He steadily assumed that Nash was always right,
[2125.48-2130.76]  and the neighbors always wrong, as to the girl's original story. He said nothing of Bennett,
[2130.76-2135.88]  the Tanner's dog had done for Bennett. He said that if the Enfield witnesses were right,
[2135.88-2142.12]  the Dorset witnesses were willfully perjured. He did not add that if Dorset witnesses were right,
[2142.12-2147.88]  the Enfield testifiers were perjured. The jury brought in a verdict of guilty of perjury,
[2147.88-2153.32]  but not willful and corrupt. This was an acquittal, but the recorder refusing the verdict,
[2153.32-2158.68]  they did what they were desired to do, and sentence was passed. Two jurors made affidavit that
[2158.68-2164.52]  they never intended a conviction. The whole point had turned in the minds of the jury on a discrepancy
[2164.52-2169.96]  as to when Elizabeth finished the water in the broken pitcher. On Wednesday, January 27th,
[2169.96-2176.20]  or on Friday, January 29th, both accounts could not be true. Here then was perjury, thought the
[2176.20-2182.92]  jury, but not willful and corrupt, not purposeful. But the jury had learned that the court was impatient.
[2182.92-2187.96]  They had already brought Elizabeth in guilty of perjury, by which they meant guilty of a casual
[2187.96-2193.32]  discrepancy not unnatural in a person hovering between life and death. They thought that they could
[2193.32-2198.12]  not go back on their guilty, and so they went all the way to corrupt and willful perjury,
[2198.12-2203.16]  murdered by false oath, and consistently added an earnest recommendation to mercy.
[2203.88-2209.96]  By a majority of one out of 17 judges, Elizabeth was banished for seven years to New England.
[2209.96-2215.00]  She was accused in the press of being an enthusiast, but the Reverend William Rainer,
[2215.00-2220.92]  who attended her in prison, publicly proclaimed her a good churchwoman and a good girl, June 7th,
[2220.92-2228.76]  1754. Elizabeth, June 24th, stuck to her guns in a manifesto. She had not once knowingly deviated
[2228.76-2234.04]  from the truth. Mr. Davy had promised the jury that when Elizabeth was once condemned,
[2234.04-2239.00]  all would come out, the whole secret. But though the most careful attempts were made to discover
[2239.00-2246.52]  her whereabouts from January 1st to January 29th, 1753, nothing was ever found out. A fact
[2246.52-2251.88]  most easily explained by the hypothesis that she was where she said she was at Mother Wells's.
[2253.00-2258.52]  As to Elizabeth's later fortunes, accounts differ, but she certainly married in Connecticut a
[2258.52-2264.44]  Mr. Treat, a respectable yeoman, said to have been opulent. She died in Connecticut in June
[2264.52-2271.08]  1773, leaving a family. In my opinion, Elizabeth Canning was a victim of the common sense of the
[2271.08-2277.32]  18th century. She told a very strange tale and common sense holds that what is strange cannot be
[2277.32-2283.80]  true, yet something strange had undeniably occurred. It was very strange of Elizabeth on the night
[2283.80-2289.16]  of January 1st, retired to become a mother, of which there was no appearance, while oven
[2289.24-2295.08]  a more even gossip could not furnish a hint. It was very strange if having thus retired, she was
[2295.08-2300.60]  robbed, starved, stripped, and brought to death's door, bleeding and broken down. It was very
[2300.60-2306.12]  strange that no vestige of evidence as to her real place of concealment could ever be discovered.
[2306.12-2312.12]  It was amazingly strange that a girl, previously and afterwards of golden character,
[2312.12-2318.44]  should in a moment aim by perjury at innocent blood. But the 18th century, as represented by Mr.
[2318.44-2324.20]  Davey, Mr. Will's, the barrister who fabled in court, and the recorder, found none of these things
[2324.20-2330.04]  one half so strange as Elizabeth Canning's story. Mr. Henry Fielding, who had some knowledge of
[2330.04-2336.28]  human nature, was of the same opinion as the present candid inquirer. In this case, writes the author
[2336.28-2342.44]  of Tom Jones, one of the most simple girls I ever saw, if she be a wicked one, have been too hard
[2342.44-2348.36]  for me. I am firmly persuaded that Elizabeth Canning is a poor, honest, simple, innocent girl.
[2349.00-2355.32]  While I'll see, but I would not have condemned the gypsy. In this case, the most perplexing thing of
[2355.32-2362.52]  all is to be found in the conflicting unpublished affidavits sworn in March 1753, when memories as to
[2362.52-2367.96]  the whereabouts of the gypsies were fresh. They form a great massive papers in the state papers
[2367.96-2373.88]  domestic at the record office. I owe to Mr. Courtney Canning my knowledge of the two unpublished
[2373.88-2379.88]  letters of fielding to the Duke of Newcastle, which follow. My Lord Duke, I received an order from
[2379.88-2385.24]  my Lord Chancellor, immediately after the breaking up of the council, to lay before your grace all the
[2385.24-2391.24]  affidavits I had taken since the gypsy trial, which related to that affair. I then told the messenger
[2391.24-2396.76]  that I had taken none. As indeed, the fact is, the affidavits of which I gave my Lord Chancellor
[2396.76-2402.12]  an abstract having been all sworn before justices of the peace in the neighborhood of Enfield,
[2402.12-2407.56]  and remain I believe in the possession of an attorney in the city. However, in consequence of
[2407.56-2413.08]  the commands with which your grace was pleased on her me yesterday, I sent my clerk immediately to
[2413.08-2418.92]  the attorney to acquaint him with the commands, which I doubt not he will instantly obey. This I did
[2418.92-2424.84]  from my great duty to your grace, for I have long had no concern in this affair, nor have I seen any
[2424.84-2430.52]  of the parties lately, unless once when I was desired to send for the girl, Canning, to my house,
[2430.52-2435.72]  that a great number of noblemen and gentlemen might see her and ask her what questions they pleased.
[2435.72-2441.32]  I am, with the highest duty, my Lord, your grace is most obedient and most humble servant Henry
[2441.32-2450.68]  Fielding. Ealing April 14th, 1753, his grace the Duke of Newcastle. Endorced, Ealing April 14th,
[2450.68-2458.68]  1753, Mr. Fielding, R. 16th. My Lord Duke, I am extremely concerned to see by a letter which I
[2458.68-2463.64]  have just received from Mr. Jones by command of your grace, that the persons concerned for the
[2463.64-2469.32]  prosecution have not yet attended your grace with the affidavits in Canning's affair. I do assure
[2469.32-2474.52]  you upon my honor that I sent to them the moment I first received your grace's commands,
[2474.52-2479.72]  and having after three messages prevailed with them to come to me, I desired them to fetch the
[2479.72-2484.92]  affidavits that I might send them to your grace, being not able to wait on your own person.
[2484.92-2489.40]  This, they said they could not do, but would go to Mr. Hume Campbell, their counsel,
[2489.40-2494.52]  and prevail with him to attend your grace with all their affidavits, many of which I found were
[2494.52-2499.80]  sworn after the day mentioned in the order of counsel. I told them I apprehended the letter could
[2499.80-2505.24]  not be admitted, but insisted in the strongest terms on their laying the others immediately before
[2505.24-2511.08]  your grace, and they at last promised me they would, nor have I ever seen them since. I have now
[2511.08-2516.12]  again ordered my clerk to go to them to inform them of the last commands I have received,
[2516.12-2520.76]  but as I have no compulsory power over them I cannot answer for their behavior,
[2520.76-2526.68]  which indeed I have long disliked, and have therefore long ago declined giving them any advice,
[2526.68-2531.72]  nor would I, unless in obedience to your grace, have anything to say to a set of the most
[2531.72-2537.00]  obstinate fools I ever saw, and you seem to me rather to act from a spleen against my Lord
[2537.80-2543.16]  than from any motive of protecting innocence, though that was certainly their motive at first.
[2543.16-2548.36]  In truth, if I am not deceived, I suspect that they desire that the gypsy should be pardoned,
[2548.36-2553.32]  and then to convince the world that she was guilty in order to cast the greater reflection on him
[2553.32-2558.52]  who is principally instrumental in obtaining such pardon. I conclude with assuring your grace
[2558.52-2563.80]  that I have acted in this affair as I shall on all occasions with the most beautiful regard to your
[2563.80-2569.32]  commands, and that if my life had been at stake as many know, I could have done no more.
[2569.32-2575.08]  I am with the highest respect my Lord Duke, your grace is most obedient and most humble servant,
[2575.08-2583.40]  Henry Fielding, Ealing, April 27th, 1753, his grace, the Duke of Newcastle, endorsed Ealing,
[2583.40-2586.76]  April 27th, 1753, Mr. Fielding.
